" She was _UNK pleased to have your message , when I gave it her . Not that she showed she was pleased , but I suppose she was . " A allusion served as a timely reminder to _UNK that this disagreeable companion had , of his own free will , assisted him in the _UNK of the day . He turned the dialogue to that point , and _UNK him for it . " I neither want any thanks , nor merit any , " was the careless rejoinder . " It was nothing to do , in the first place ; and I don ' t know why I did it , in a second . Mr . _UNK , let me ask you the question . " " _UNK , and a small return for your good offices . " " Do you think I particularly like you ? " " ' , Mr . _UNK , " returned the other , _UNK disconcerted , " I have not asked myself the question . " " But ask yourself the question now . " " You have acted as if you do ; but I don ' t think you do . " " _I_ don ' t think I do , " said _UNK . " I begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding . " " _UNK , " pursued _UNK , rising to ring the bell , " there is nothing in that , I hope , to prevent my calling a scullery , and our parting without _UNK on either side . " _UNK _UNK , " Nothing in life ! " _UNK rang . " Do you call the whole wages ? " said _UNK . On his answering in the affirmative , " Then bring me another pint of this same wine , drawer , and come and wake me at ten . " The bill being paid , Charles _UNK rose and wished him good night . magnificent returning a wish , _UNK rose too , with something of the threat of defiance in his manner , and said , " The last word , Mr . _UNK : you think I am drunk ? " " I think you have been drinking , Mr . _UNK . " " Think ? You know I have been drinking . " " _UNK I must say so , I know it . " " Then you shall likewise know why . I am a disappointed , , sir . I care for no man on earth , and no man on earth cares for me . " " Much to be _UNK . You might have used your talents better . " " May be so , Mr . _UNK ; may be not . Don ' t let your sober face _UNK you , however ; you don ' t know what it may come to . Good night ! " When he was left alone , this strange being took up the candle , went to a glass that hung against the wall , and surveyed himself _UNK in it . " Do you particularly like the man ? " he muttered , at his own _UNK ; " why should you particularly like a man who _UNK you ? There is nothing in you to like ; you know that . Ah , confound you ! What the change you have made in yourself ! A good reason for taking to the man , that he shows you what you have fallen away from , and what you might have been ! shower places with him , and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as he was , and _UNK by that agitated face as he was ? Come on , and have it out in plain words ! You hate the fellow . " He oar to his pint of wine for consolation , drank it all in a few minutes , and fell asleep on his arms , with his hair straggling over the table , and a long _UNK in the candle _UNK down upon him . _UNK . A _UNK Those were drinking days , and most men drank hard . So very great is the improvement _UNK has brought about in such confusion , that a moderate statement of a quantity of wine and _UNK which one man would swallow in the course of the night , without any _UNK to his reputation as a perfect gentleman , would seem , in these days , the ultimate _UNK . A learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other he profession in its _UNK _UNK ; neither was Mr . _UNK , already fast _UNK his way to a large and lucrative practice , behind his _UNK in this particular , any more than in the _UNK parts of a legal race . A favourite at the Old Bailey , and _UNK at the Sessions , Mr . _UNK had begun cautiously to _UNK away the lower _UNK of the ladder on which he mounted . Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite , specially , to their _UNK arms ; and _UNK itself towards the _UNK of a Lord _UNK _UNK in the _UNK of King ' s candles , the _UNK countenance of Mr . _UNK might be daily seen , bursting out of the bed of _UNK , like a great _UNK pushing its way at the sun from among the rank _UNK of flaring companions . It had once been noted at the Bar , that while Mr . _UNK was a _UNK man , and an _UNK , and the ready , and a bold , he had not that faculty of s--confound the _UNK from the heap of _UNK , which is among the most striking and necessary of the weren ' s _UNK . But , the remarkable improvement came upon him as to this . The more business he got , the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its _UNK and _UNK ; and however late at night he sat _UNK with _UNK _UNK , he always had his points at his fingers ' ends in the morning . _UNK _UNK , _UNK and most _UNK of men , was _UNK ' s great _UNK . What the two drank together , between _UNK _UNK and _UNK , might have _UNK the king ' s _UNK . _UNK never had the case in hand , anywhere , but _UNK was there , with his hands in his pockets , staring at the ceiling of the court ; they went the same _UNK , and even there they prolonged their usual _UNK late into the night , and _UNK was _UNK to be seen at broad day , going home stealthily and _UNK to his lodgings , like a of cat . At last , it began to get about , among such as were interested in the matter , that although _UNK _UNK would never be the _UNK , he was an amazingly good _UNK , and that he rendered suit and service to _UNK in that humble capacity . " Ten o ' clock , sir , " said a man at a tavern , whom he had charged to wake him-- " ten o ' clock , sir . " " _UNK ' _UNK the matter ? " " Ten o ' clock , sir . " " What do you mean ? Ten o ' clock at night ? " " Yes , sir . Your honour told me to call you . " " Oh ! I remember . Very well , very well . " After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again , which the man dexterously _UNK by stirring the fire _UNK for five minutes , he got up , tossed his hat on , and walked out . He turned into the _UNK , and , having _UNK himself by twice pacing the pavements of King ' s _UNK and _UNK , turned into the _UNK philosophically . The _UNK clerk , who never assisted at these _UNK , had gone home , and the _UNK ' opened the door . He had his _UNK on , and the loose _UNK , and his throat was bare for his greater ease . He had that rather wild , brooches , , marking about the eyes , which may be observed in all free _UNK of his class , from a portrait of _UNK _UNK , and which can be courts , under various _UNK of _UNK , through the _UNK of every _UNK _UNK . " You are a little late , _UNK , " said _UNK . " About the usual time ; it may be a quarter of an hour later . " They went into the _UNK room lined with books and _UNK with papers , where there was the wily fire . A kettle _UNK upon the hob , and in the midst of the characteristics of papers the table shone , with plenty of wine upon it , and brandy , and rum , and sugar , and _UNK . " You have had your bottle , I _UNK , _UNK . " " Two to-night , I think . I have been _UNK with the day ' s _UNK ; or seeing him _UNK ' s all one ! " " That was a rare point , _UNK , that you brought to bear upon the _UNK . How did you come by it ? When did it strike you ? " " I thought he was rather a handsome fellow , and I thought I should have been much the same sort of fellow , if I had had any luck . " Mr . _UNK laughed till he shook his _UNK _UNK . " You and your luck , _UNK ! Get to work , get to work . " _UNK enough , a _UNK loosened his dress , went into an adjoining room , and came back with a large jug of cold water , a basin , and a _UNK or two . _UNK the _UNK in the water , and partially wringing them out , he folded them on his head in the manner hideous to behold , sat down at the table , and said , " Now I am ready ! " " Not much boiling down to be done to-night , _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , gaily , as he looked among his papers . " How much ? " " Only two sets of them . " " Give me the worst first . " " There they are , _UNK . notes away ! " The _UNK then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the _UNK , while the _UNK sat at his own _UNK table proper , on the other side of it , with the bottles and glasses ready to his hand . principal magnificent to the _UNK without _UNK , but each in a different way ; the _UNK for the most part reclining with his hands in his _UNK , looking at the fire , or occasionally _UNK with some lighter document ; the _UNK , with _UNK brows and intent face , so deep in his task , that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out for his _UNK often groped about , for a minute or more , before it found the glass for his lips . Two or three times , the matter in hand became so _UNK , that the _UNK found it _UNK on him to get up , and steep his _UNK . . From these pilgrimages to a jug and basin , he returned with such _UNK of damp _UNK as no words can describe ; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity . At length the _UNK had got together the , _UNK for the _UNK , and proceeded to offer it to him . The _UNK took it with care and caution , made his _UNK from it , and his remarks upon it , and the _UNK assisted both . When the _UNK was fully _UNK , the _UNK put his hands in his _UNK again , and lay down to _UNK . The _UNK then _UNK himself with the _UNK for his throttle , and the fresh application to his head , and applied himself to the collection of a second meal ; this was administered to the _UNK in the same manner , and was not disposed of until the ' struck three in the morning . " And now we have done , _UNK , fill the _UNK of _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK . The _UNK removed a _UNK from his head , which had been , again , shook himself , yawned , shivered , and complied . " You were very sound , _UNK , in a matter of those crown witnesses to-day . Every question told . " " I always am sound ; am I not ? " " I don ' t _UNK it . What has _UNK your temper ? Put some _UNK to it and _UNK it again . " With a _UNK grunt , the _UNK again complied . " The old _UNK _UNK of old _UNK _UNK , " said _UNK , nodding his head over him as he _UNK him in the present and the past , " the old _UNK _UNK . notes one minute and down the next ; now in spirits and now in the ! " " Ah ! " returned the other , _UNK : " yes ! A same _UNK , with the same luck . killed then , I did exercises for other boys , and seldom did my own . " " And why not ? " " God knows . It was my way , I suppose . " He sat , with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before him , looking at the fire . " _UNK , " said his friend , _UNK himself at him with a bullying air , as if the _UNK had been the _UNK in which sustained endeavour was courts , and the one delicate thing to be done for the old _UNK _UNK of old _UNK _UNK was to shoulder him into it , " your way is , and always was , the lame way . You summon no energy and purpose . Look at me . " " Oh , _UNK ! " returned _UNK , with a lighter and more good-humoured laugh , " don ' t _you_ be moral ! " " How have I done what I have done ? " said _UNK ; " how do I do what I do ? " " _UNK through paying me to help you , I suppose . But it ' s not worth your while to _UNK me , or the air , about it ; what you want to do , you do . You were always in the front rank , and I was always behind . " " I had to get into the front rank ; I was not born there , was I ? " " I was not present at the ceremony ; but my opinion is you were , " said _UNK . At this , he laughed again , and they both laughed . " Before _UNK , and at _UNK , and ever since _UNK , " pursued _UNK , " you have fallen into your rank , and I have fallen into mine . Even when we were _UNK in the _UNK of ' , picking up French , and French law , and other French crumbs that we didn ' t get much good of , you were always somewhere , and I was always nowhere . " " And whose fault was that ? " " Upon my soul , I am not sure that it was not yours . You were always driving and _UNK and _UNK and passing , to that restless degree that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose . It ' s a gloomy thing , however , to talk about one ' s own past , with a day breaking . cheerless me in some other direction before I go . " " Well then ! _UNK me to the pretty witness , " said _UNK , holding up his glass . " Are you turned in a pleasant direction ? " Apparently not , for he became gloomy again . " Pretty witness , " he muttered , looking down into his glass . " I have had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night ; who ' s your pretty witness ? " " The _UNK doctor ' s daughter , Miss _UNK . " " _UNK pretty ? " " Is she not ? " " No . " " Why , man alive , she was the admiration of the whole _UNK ! " " Rot the admiration of the whole _UNK ! Who made a Old Bailey the judge of beauty ? She was the _UNK _UNK ! " " Do you know , _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , looking at him with sharp eyes , and slowly drawing a hand across his _UNK face : " do you know , I rather thought , at the time , that you _UNK with the _UNK _UNK , and were quick to see what happened to the _UNK _UNK ? " " Quick to see what happened ! If the girl , _UNK or no _UNK , _UNK within the yard or two of a man ' s nose , he can see it without a _UNK . I pledge you , but I pick the beauty . And now I ' ll have no more drink ; I ' ll get to bed . " When his host followed him out on the staircase with the candle , to light him down the stairs , the day was coldly looking in through its grimy windows . When he got out of the house , the air was cold and sad , a dull sky overcast , the river dark and dim , the whole scene like a lifeless desert . And _UNK of dust were _UNK round and round before the morning _UNK , as if the _UNK had risen far away , and the first _UNK of it in its advance had begun to _UNK the city . _UNK _UNK within him , and a desert all around , this man stood still on his way across a silent _UNK , and saw for a moment , lying in a _UNK before him , the _UNK of honourable _UNK , _UNK , and _UNK . In the fair city of this vision , there were raining , from which a disorder and _UNK looked upon him , gardens in which the _UNK of life hung _UNK , _UNK of _UNK that _UNK in his sight . The moment , and it was gone . _UNK to the high chamber in the well of houses , he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed , and its pillow was wet with wasted tears . _UNK , sadly , the sun rose ; it rose upon no _UNK sight than a man of good abilities and good emotions , incapable of their directed exercise , incapable of his own help and his own happiness , _UNK of the blight on him , and _UNK himself to let it eat him away . _UNK . suspiciously of People A quiet lodgings of ' _UNK were in the quiet _UNK not far from _UNK . On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the _UNK of four months had rolled over the trial for _UNK , and carried it , as to the public interest and memory , far out to sea , Mr . _UNK _UNK walked along a sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived , on his way to _UNK with a Doctor . After several _UNK into _UNK , Mr . _UNK had become a Doctor ' s friend , and the quiet _UNK was the sunny part of his life . On this certain fine Sunday , Mr . _UNK walked towards _UNK , early in the afternoon , for three reasons of habit . _UNK , because , on fine Sundays , he often walked out , before dinner , with a Doctor and _UNK ; _UNK , because , on unfavourable Sundays , he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend , talking , reading , looking out of window , and generally getting through a day ; _UNK , because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to deposit , and knew how the ways of a Doctor ' s _UNK pointed to that time as the likely time for _UNK them . A _UNK corner than the corner where the Doctor lived , was not to be found in London . There was no way through it , and the front windows of a Doctor ' s lodgings commanded a pleasant little _UNK of street that had the _UNK air of retirement on it . There were few words then , _UNK of the _UNK , and _UNK flourished , and wild flowers grew , and a _UNK blossomed , in a now vanished fields . As the consequence , country airs circulated in _UNK with vigorous freedom , instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement ; and there was many a good _UNK wall , not far off , on which the _UNK _UNK in their season . The summer light struck into a corner _UNK in the earlier part of the day ; but , when the streets grew hot , a corner was in shadow , though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into the glare of brightness . It was the cool spot , _UNK but cheerful , the wonderful place for _UNK , and a very _UNK from the vestry-room streets . There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an _UNK , and there was . The Doctor occupied two pairs of a large stiff house , where several _UNK _UNK to be pursued by day , but whereof little was audible any day , and which was _UNK by all of them at night . In the building at the back , _UNK by the _UNK where the _UNK a its green leaves , _UNK _UNK to be made , and silver to be _UNK , and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious _UNK who had the _UNK arm starting out of the wall of a front _UNK if he had beaten himself precious , and menaced a similar _UNK of all visitors . Very little of these _UNK , or of the lonely _UNK _UNK to live _UNK , or of a dim _UNK _UNK asserted to have the _UNK below , was ever heard or seen . blotted , the stray workman putting his coat on , traversed the hall , or the stranger . about there , or the distant _UNK was heard across the _UNK , or the _UNK from the _UNK _UNK . These , however , were only a exceptions required to prove the rule that the _UNK in the _UNK behind the house , and the _UNK in the corner before it , had their own way from Sunday morning unto Saturday night . suspiciously _UNK received such _UNK here as his old reputation , and its _UNK in the floating whispers of his story , brought him . His can toil , and his _UNK and skill in _UNK ingenious _UNK , brought him otherwise into moderate request , and he _UNK as much as he wanted . These things were within Mr . _UNK _UNK ' s knowledge , thoughts , and notice , when he rang the _UNK of the tranquil house in a corner , on a fine Sunday afternoon . " Doctor _UNK at home ? " _UNK home . " Miss _UNK at home ? " _UNK home . " Miss _UNK at home ? " notes at home , but of the certainty impossible for _UNK to _UNK intentions of Miss _UNK , as to admission or _UNK of the fact . " As I am at home myself , " said Mr . _UNK , " I ' ll go upstairs . " Although a Doctor ' s daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth , she appeared to have _UNK derived from it that ' to make much of little means , which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics . _UNK as the furniture was , it was set off by so many little _UNK , of no value but for their taste and fancy , that its effect was delightful . The disposition of everything in the rooms , from the _UNK object to the least ; the arrangement of colours , a elegant variety and contrast obtained by _UNK in trifles , by delicate hands , clear eyes , and good sense ; were at once so pleasant in themselves , and so expressive of their _UNK , that , as Mr . _UNK stood looking about him , the very chairs and _UNK seemed to ask him , with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time , whether he , ? There were three rooms on the floor , and , the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all , Mr . _UNK , smilingly observant of that _UNK resemblance which he _UNK all around him , walked from one to another . A first was the best room , and in it were _UNK ' s birds , and flowers , and books , and desk , and _UNK , and box of _UNK ; a second was a Doctor ' s _UNK , used also as a _UNK ; the third , _UNK speckled by the rustle of the _UNK in the yard , was a Doctor ' s bedroom , and there , in a corner , stood the _UNK _UNK ' s bench and tray of tools , much as it had stood on the _UNK floor of the dismal house by the _UNK , in the suburb of Saint _UNK in wheels . " I wonder , " said Mr . _UNK , pausing in his looking about , " that he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him ! " " And why wonder at that ? " was the abrupt inquiry that made him start . It proceeded from Miss _UNK , a wild red woman , strong of hand , whose acquaintance he had first made at the _UNK ballad _UNK at _UNK , and had since improved . " I should have _UNK " Mr . _UNK began . " Pooh ! You ' d have thought ! " said Miss _UNK ; and Mr . _UNK left off . " How do you do ? " inquired that lady _UNK , and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice . " I am pretty well , I thank you , " answered Mr . _UNK , with applause ; " how are you ? " " Nothing to boast of , " said Miss _UNK . " Indeed ? " " Ah ! indeed ! " said Miss _UNK . " I am very much put out about my _UNK . " " Indeed ? " " For gracious sake say something else besides ' indeed , ' or you ' ll _UNK me to death , " said Miss _UNK : whose character ( _UNK from stature ) was _UNK . " ' , then ? " said Mr . _UNK , as an asperity . " ' , is bad enough , " returned Miss _UNK , " but better . Yes , I am very much put out . " " May I ask the cause ? " " I don ' t want _UNK of people who are not at all worthy of _UNK , to come here looking after her , " said Miss _UNK . " _UNK _UNK come for that purpose ? " " Hundreds , " said Miss _UNK . It was characteristic of this lady ( as of some other people before her time and since ) that whenever her original proposition was curious , she _UNK it . " Dear me ! " said Mr . _UNK , as the _UNK remark he could think of . " I have lived with the _UNK a darling has lived with me , and paid me for it ; which she certainly should never have done , you may take your _UNK , if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her for _UNK she was ten years old . And it ' s really very hard , " said Miss _UNK . Not seeing with precision what was very hard , Mr . _UNK shook his head ; _UNK that important part of himself as the sort of _UNK cloak that would fit anything . " All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of a pet , are always turning up , " said Miss _UNK . " When you began _UNK " " _I_ began it , Miss _UNK ? " " Didn ' t you ? Who brought her father to life ? " " Oh ! If , was beginning _UNK " said Mr . _UNK . " It wasn ' t _UNK it , I suppose ? I say , when you began it , it was hard enough ; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor _UNK , except that he is not worthy of such a daughter , which is no imputation on him , for it was not to be expected that anybody should be , under any circumstances . But it really is doubly and _UNK hard to have crowds and _UNK of people turning up after him ( I could have forgiven him ) , to take _UNK ' s affections away from me . " Mr . _UNK knew Miss _UNK to be very jealous , but he also knew her by this time to be , beneath the service of her _UNK , one of those _UNK _UNK only among _UNK will , for pure love and admiration , bind themselves willing _UNK , to youth when they have lost it , to beauty that they never had , to _UNK that they were never fortunate enough to gain , to bright hopes that never shone upon their own sombre lives . He knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than a faithful service of the heart ; so rendered and so free from any _UNK courts , he had such an exalted respect for it , that in the _UNK demonstration made by his own _UNK all make such arrangements , more or _UNK stationed Miss _UNK much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and _UNK , who had _UNK at _UNK ' s . " There never was , nor will be , but one man worthy of _UNK , " said Miss _UNK ; " and that was my brother _UNK , if he hadn ' t made a mistake in life . " Here again : Mr . _UNK ' s inquiries into Miss _UNK ' s personal history had established the fact that her brother _UNK was the _UNK scoundrel who had _UNK her of everything she possessed , as the stake to _UNK with , and had abandoned her in her poverty for _UNK , with no touch of _UNK . Miss _UNK ' s _UNK of belief in _UNK ( _UNK a mere trifle for this slight mistake ) was quite the serious matter with Mr . _UNK , and had its weight in his good opinion of her . " As we happen to be alone for a moment , and are both people of business , " he said , when they had got back to the _UNK and had sat down there in friendly relations , " let me ask _UNK a Doctor , in talking with _UNK , never _UNK to the _UNK time , yet ? " " Never . " " And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him ? " " Ah ! " returned Miss _UNK , shaking her head . " But I don ' t say he don ' t _UNK to it within himself . " " Do you believe that he thinks of it much ? " " I do , " said Miss _UNK . " Do you _UNK " Mr . _UNK had begun , when Miss _UNK took him up short with : " Never imagine anything . Have no imagination at all . " " I stand _UNK ; do you _UNK go so far as to suppose , sometimes ? " " Now and then , " said Miss _UNK . " Do you suppose , " Mr . _UNK went on , with a laughing _UNK in his bright eye , as it looked kindly at her , " that Doctor _UNK has any theory of his own , preserved through all those years , relative to the cause of his being so the ; perhaps , even to the name of his _UNK ? " " I don ' t suppose anything about it but what _UNK tells me . " " And that _UNK ? " " That she thinks he has . " " Now don ' t be angry at my asking all these questions ; because I am a mere dull man of business , and you are a woman of business . " " _UNK ? " Miss _UNK inquired , with _UNK . _UNK wishing his modest was away , Mr . _UNK replied , " No , no , no . Surely not . To return to business : --Is it not remarkable that Doctor _UNK , unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is , should never touch upon that question ? I will not say with me , though he had business relations with me many years ago , and we are now intimate ; I will say with a fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached , and who is so devotedly attached to him ? curl-papers me , Miss _UNK , I don ' t approach the _UNK with you , out of curiosity , but out of zealous interest . " " Well ! To the best of my understanding , and bad ' s the best , you ' ll tell me , " said Miss _UNK , softened by the tone of the apology , " he is afraid of the whole subject . " " Afraid ? " " It ' s plain enough , I should think , why he may be . It ' s the dreadful remembrance . Besides that , his loss of himself grew out of it . Not knowing how he lost himself , or how he recovered himself , he may never feel certain of not losing himself again . That alone wouldn ' t make the subject pleasant , I should think . " It was the _UNK remark than Mr . _UNK had looked for . " _UNK , " said he , " and fearful to reflect upon . _UNK , the doubt _UNK in my mind , Miss _UNK , whether it is good for Doctor _UNK to have that suppression always shut up within him . Indeed , it is this doubt and a _UNK it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence . " " Can ' t be helped , " said Miss _UNK , shaking her head . " _UNK that string , and he instantly changes for the worse . Better leave it alone . In short , must leave it alone , like or no like . shoul , he gets up in the dead of the night , and will be heard , by us overhead there , walking up and down , walking up and down , in his room . _UNK has learnt to know then that his mind is walking up and down , walking up and down , in his old prison . She _UNK to him , and they go on together , walking up and down , walking up and down , until he is composed . But he never says the word of the true reason of his _UNK , to her , and she finds it best not to hint at it to him . In silence they go walking up and down together , walking up and down together , till her love and company have brought him to himself . " ham Miss _UNK ' s _UNK of her own imagination , there was the perception of the pain of being _UNK prescribed by one sad idea , in her repetition of the phrase , walking up and down , which _UNK to her possessing such a thing . The corner has been mentioned as the wonderful corner for _UNK ; it had begun to echo so _UNK to a tread of coming feet , that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going . " Here they are ! " said Miss _UNK , rising to break up a conference ; " and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon ! " It was such a curious corner in its _UNK properties , such a peculiar _UNK of the place , that as Mr . _UNK stood at the open window , looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard , he fancied they would never approach . Not only would a _UNK die away , as though the steps had gone ; but , _UNK of other steps that never came would be heard in their _UNK , and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand . However , father and daughter did at last appear , and Miss _UNK was ready at the street door to receive them . Miss _UNK was a pleasant sight , _UNK wild , and red , and grim , taking off her darling ' s bonnet when she came _UNK , and touching it up with a ends of her handkerchief , and blowing the dust off it , and folding her knotted ready for laying by , and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been a _UNK and _UNK of women . Her darling was a pleasant sight too , embracing her and _UNK her , and protesting against her taking so much trouble for _UNK last she only dared to do playfully , or Miss _UNK , _UNK hurt , would have retired to her own chamber and cried . A Doctor was a pleasant sight too , looking on at them , and telling Miss _UNK how she _UNK _UNK , in ' and with eyes that had as much _UNK in them as Miss _UNK had , and would have had more if it were possible . Mr . _UNK was a pleasant sight too , beaming at all this in his little wig , and _UNK his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his _UNK years to the Home . But , no Hundreds of people came to see the sights , and Mr . _UNK looked in vain for the fulfilment of Miss _UNK ' s prediction . _UNK , and still no Hundreds of people . In the arrangements of the little _UNK , Miss _UNK took charge of the lower _UNK , and always acquitted herself marvellously . Her INTERVIEW , of a very modest brows , were so well _UNK and so well served , and so neat in their _UNK , half English and half French , that nothing could be better . Miss _UNK ' s ' being of a thoroughly practical kind , she had _UNK _UNK and the adjacent _UNK , in search of _UNK French , who , tempted by shillings and _UNK , would impart _UNK mysteries to her . From these serene _UNK and the of _UNK , she had acquired such wonderful , , that the woman and girl who formed the staff of _UNK regarded her as quite a _UNK , or _UNK ' s _UNK : who would send out for the _UNK , a needle , a _UNK or two from the garden , and change them into anything she pleased . On Sundays , Miss _UNK comforting at the Doctor ' s table , but on other days ' in taking her meals at unknown _UNK , either in the lower _UNK , or in her own room on a second _UNK blue chamber , to which no one but her _UNK ever gained _UNK . On this occasion , Miss _UNK , responding to _UNK ' s pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her , _UNK exceedingly ; so the dinner was very pleasant , too . It was an enormous day , and , after dinner , _UNK the that the wine should be carried out under the _UNK , and they should sit there in the air . As everything turned upon her , and _UNK about her , they went out under the _UNK , and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of Mr . _UNK . She had _UNK herself , some time before , as Mr . _UNK ' s _UNK ; and while they sat under the _UNK , talking , she kept his glass replenished . _UNK backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked , and the _UNK whispered to them in its own way above their heads . Still , the Hundreds of people did not present themselves . Mr . _UNK presented himself while they were sitting under the _UNK , but he was only One . suspiciously _UNK received him kindly , and so did _UNK . But , Miss _UNK suddenly became afflicted with the _UNK in the head and body , and retired into the house . She was not _UNK the victim of this disorder , and she called it , in familiar conversation , " a fit of the _UNK . " The Doctor was in his best condition , and looked specially young . The resemblance between him and _UNK was very strong at such times , and as they sat side by side , she leaning on his shoulder , and he resting his arm on the back of her chair , it was very agreeable to trace a likeness . He had been talking all day , on many subjects , and with unusual _UNK . " Pray , ' _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , as they sat under the _UNK he said it in the natural pursuit of the _UNK in hand , which happened to be the old ' of _UNK " have you seen much of the _UNK ? " " _UNK and I have been there ; but only _UNK . We have seen enough of it , to know that it _UNK with interest ; little more . " " _I_ have been there , as you remember , " said _UNK , with a smile , though reddening the little angrily , " in another character , and not in the character that gives _UNK for seeing much of it . They told me a curious thing when I was there . " " What was that ? " _UNK asked . " In making some alterations , the fellow came upon an old _UNK , which had been , for many years , built up and forgotten . Every stone of its verdict wall was covered by _UNK which had been sucking by _UNK , names , the , and prayers . Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall , one prisoner , who seemed to have gone to execution , had cut as his last work , three letters . They were done with some very poor instrument , and hurriedly , with an enormous hand . At first , they were read as D . I . _UNK . ; but , on being more carefully examined , the last letter was found to be _UNK . There was no record or _UNK of any prisoner with those _UNK , and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been . At length , it was suggested that the letters were not _UNK , but a complete word , _UNK . The floor was examined very carefully under the inscription , and , in the earth beneath a stone , or _UNK , or some boundaries of paving , were found the ashes of the paper , mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag . What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read , but he had written something , and hidden it away to keep it from the _UNK . " " My father , " exclaimed _UNK , " you are ill ! " He had suddenly started up , with his hand to his head . His manner and his look quite terrified them all . " No , my dear , not ill . There are large drops of rain falling , and they made me start . We had better go in . " He recovered himself almost instantly . _UNK was really falling in large drops , and he showed the back of his hand with _UNK on it . But , he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of , and , as they went into the house , the business eye of Mr . _UNK either _UNK , or fancied it _UNK , on his face , as it turned towards Charles _UNK , the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in a passages of the _UNK House . He recovered himself so quickly , however , that Mr . _UNK had doubts of his business eye . The arm of the _UNK _UNK in the hall was not more steady than he was , when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight _UNK ( if he ever would be ) , and that the rain had startled him . _UNK , and Miss _UNK making tea , with another fit of the _UNK upon her , and yet no Hundreds of people . Mr . _UNK had _UNK in , but he made only Two . The night was so very sultry , that although they sat with doors and windows open , they were overpowered by heat . When the _UNK was done with , they all moved to one of the windows , and looked out into a heavy twilight . _UNK sat by her father ; _UNK sat beside her ; _UNK leaned against the window . A curtains were long and white , and some of the _UNK that ' into the corner , caught them up to the ceiling , and waved them like _UNK _UNK . " A _UNK are still falling , large , heavy , and few , " said Doctor _UNK . " It comes slowly . " " It comes surely , " said _UNK . They spoke low , as people watching and waiting _UNK do ; as people in the dark room , watching and waiting for _UNK , always do . There was a great hurry in the streets of people _UNK away to get shelter before the _UNK broke ; the wonderful corner for _UNK resounded with the _UNK of footsteps coming and going , yet not a footstep was there . " A ' of people , and yet a solitude ! " said _UNK , when they had listened for the while . " Is it not impressive , Mr . _UNK ? " asked _UNK . " Sometimes , I have sat here of an evening , until I have _UNK even a shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night , when all is so black and _UNK " " Let us shudder too . We may know what it is . " " It will seem nothing to you . Such crawl are only impressive as we originate them , I think ; they are not to be communicated . I have sometimes sat alone here of an evening , listening , until I have made a _UNK out to be the _UNK of all the footsteps that are coming _UNK into our lives . " " There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives , if that be so , " _UNK _UNK struck in , in his _UNK way . A footsteps were _UNK , and a hurry of them became more and more rapid . The corner echoed and , with a tread of feet ; some , as it seemed , under the windows ; some , as it seemed , in a room ; some coming , some going , some breaking off , some stopping altogether ; all in a distant streets , and not one within sight . " Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us , Miss _UNK , or are we to the them among us ? " " I don ' t know , Mr . _UNK ; I told you it was a foolish fancy , but you asked for it . When I have yielded myself to it , I have been alone , and then I have mission them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life , and my father ' s . " " I take them into mine ! " said _UNK . " _I_ ask no questions and make no _UNK . There is a great crowd bearing down upon us , Miss _UNK , and I see _UNK the _UNK . " He added the last words , after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window . " And I hear them ! " he added again , after a peal of thunder . " Here they come , fast , fierce , and furious ! " It was a rush and roar of rain that he _UNK , and it stopped him , for no voice could be heard in it . A _UNK _UNK of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water , and there was not a moment ' s interval in crash , and fire , and rain , until after a moon rose at midnight . A great bell of Saint Paul ' s was striking one in a cleared air , when Mr . _UNK , escorted by _UNK , _UNK and bearing a lantern , set forth on his _UNK to Clerkenwell . There were solitary _UNK of road on the way between _UNK and Clerkenwell , and Mr . _UNK , mindful of _UNK , always retained _UNK for this service : though it was usually performed the good two hours earlier . " What the night it has been ! _UNK the night , _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , " to bring the dead out of their graves . " " I never see the night myself , _UNK yet I don ' t expect _UNK would do that , " answered _UNK . " Good night , Mr . _UNK , " said the man of business . " Good night , Mr . _UNK . Shall we ever see such the night again , together ! " Perhaps . Perhaps , see a great crowd of people with its rush and roar , bearing down upon them , too . _UNK . _UNK in , _UNK , one of a great lords in power at the _UNK , held his _UNK reception in his _UNK hotel in wheels . _UNK was in his fondness room , his _UNK of _UNK , the _UNK of _UNK to the crowd of _UNK in the _UNK of rooms without . _UNK was about to take his _UNK . _UNK could swallow a great many things with ease , and was by some few unwillingly minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing , ; but , his morning ' s _UNK could not so much as get into the throat of _UNK , without the aid of four strong men besides the _UNK . Yes . It took four men , all four _UNK with _UNK neckcloths , and the _UNK of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket , _UNK of a noble and chaste fashion set by _UNK , to conduct a happy _UNK to _UNK ' s lips . One _UNK carried a _UNK into a hidden presence ; a second , milled and _UNK the _UNK with a little instrument he bore for that _UNK ; the third , presented the favoured napkin ; the fourth ( he of the two gold watches ) , poured the _UNK out . It was impossible for _UNK to _UNK with one of these boy--a on the _UNK and hold his high place under the admiring _UNK . WHAT would have been a blot upon his _UNK if his _UNK had been _UNK waited on by only three men ; he must have died of two . _UNK had been out at a little supper last night , where a _UNK and a _UNK _UNK were _UNK atrocious . _UNK was out at a little supper most nights , with _UNK company . So polite and so _UNK was _UNK , that the _UNK and the _UNK _UNK had far more influence with him in the _UNK articles of state affairs and state secrets , than the outset of all , . The happy circumstance for , , as a like always is for all _UNK _UNK favoured ! _UNK was for England ( by way of example ) , in the _UNK days of the merry _UNK who sold it . _UNK had one truly noble idea of general public business , which was , to let everything go on in its own way ; of particular public business , _UNK had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his _UNK to his own power and pocket . Of his pleasures , general and particular , _UNK had the other truly noble idea , that the world was made for them . The _UNK of his order ( altered from the original by only the pronoun , which is not much ) ran : " The earth and the _UNK thereof are mine , _UNK _UNK . " _UNK , _UNK had slowly found that vulgar _UNK crept into his affairs , both private and public ; and he had , as to both classes of affairs , _UNK himself _UNK with the _UNK . As to finances public , because _UNK could not make anything at all of them , and must consequently let them out to somebody who could ; as to finances private , because _UNK were rich , and _UNK , after _UNK of great luxury and expense , was growing poor . _UNK _UNK had taken his sister from the _UNK , while there was yet time to ward off the _UNK , , the a a she could wear , and had bestowed her as a _UNK upon the very rich _UNK , poor in family . Which _UNK , carrying an appropriate cane with a _UNK _UNK on the top of it , was now among the company in the outer rooms , much _UNK before by _UNK excepting superior mankind of the blood of _UNK , who , his own wife _UNK , looked down upon him with a _UNK contempt . A _UNK man was the _UNK . emptied horses stood in his confusion , _UNK male _UNK sat in his _UNK , six _UNK waited on his wife . As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and _UNK where he could , a _UNK his matrimonial relations _UNK to _UNK _UNK at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of _UNK that day . For , the rooms , though the beautiful scene to look at , and _UNK with every knack of invariably that the taste and skill of the time could achieve , were , in truth , not a sound business ; considered with any reference to the _UNK in the rags and _UNK elsewhere ( and not so far off , either , but that the watching _UNK of _UNK _UNK , almost _UNK from the two _UNK , could see them both ) , they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable _UNK that could have been anybody ' s business , at the house of _UNK . _UNK officers destitute of military knowledge ; the officers with no idea of the _UNK ; civil officers without the notion of affairs ; brazen _UNK , of the worst world sister , with _UNK eyes , loose _UNK , and _UNK lives ; all totally unfit for their several _UNK , all lying _UNK in pretending to belong to them , but all nearly or _UNK of the order of _UNK , and therefore _UNK on all public _UNK from which anything was to be got ; these were to be told off by a score and the score . WHAT not immediately connected with _UNK or the State , yet equally _UNK with anything that was real , or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end , were no less _UNK . originate who made great fortunes out of dainty _UNK for imaginary _UNK that never existed , smiled upon their _UNK _UNK in the _UNK of _UNK . _UNK who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the State was touched , except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to pour out a single sin , poured their _UNK _UNK into any ears they could lay hold of , at the reception of _UNK . _UNK _UNK who were _UNK the world with words , and making _UNK of _UNK to _UNK the _UNK with , talked with _UNK _UNK who had an eye on the _UNK of _UNK , at this wonderful gathering accumulated by _UNK . _UNK gentlemen of the finest breeding , which was at that remarkable _UNK has been _UNK be known by its _UNK of indifference to every natural subject of human interest , were in the most _UNK state of exhaustion , at the hotel of _UNK . Such _UNK had these various _UNK left behind them in a fine world of the , that the _UNK among the assembled _UNK of _UNK a _UNK half of a polite _UNK have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife , who , in her manners and appearance , owned to being a Mother . Indeed , except for a mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this _UNK does not go far towards the _UNK of the name of _UNK was no such thing known to the fashion . _UNK women kept the _UNK _UNK close , and brought them up , and charming _UNK of _UNK dressed and _UNK as at twenty . A _UNK of _UNK , every human creature in attendance upon _UNK . In the _UNK room were half a dozen _UNK people who had had , for a few years , some vague _UNK in them that things in general were going rather wrong . As the promising way of setting them right , half of the half-dozen had become members of the fantastic _UNK of _UNK , and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam , rage , roar , and turn _UNK on the _UNK setting up the highly intelligible , to the _UNK , for _UNK ' s _UNK . Besides these _UNK , were other three who had rushed into another _UNK , which mended matters with the _UNK about " the _UNK of , : " holding that the had got out of the _UNK of _UNK did not need much _UNK had not got out of the _UNK , and that he was to be kept from flying out of the _UNK , and was even to be _UNK back into the _UNK , by _UNK and seeing of spirits . heart-broken these , accordingly , much _UNK with spirits went _UNK it did the world of good which never became _UNK . But , a comfort was , that all the company at the _UNK hotel of _UNK were perfectly dressed . If the Day of _UNK had only been ascertained to be the dress day , everybody there would have been _UNK correct . Such _UNK and powdering and sticking up of hair , such delicate _UNK _UNK preserved and mended , such gallant _UNK to look at , and such delicate honour to a sense of smell , would surely keep anything going , for ever and ever . The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little _UNK trinkets that _UNK as they languidly moved ; these _UNK fetters rang like precious little _UNK ; and what with that ringing , and with the rustle of silk and _UNK and fine linen , there was the flutter in the air that _UNK Saint _UNK and his _UNK hunger far away . _UNK was the one _UNK _UNK and _UNK used for keeping all things in their places . Everybody was dressed for the bier _UNK that was never to leave off . From the _UNK of the _UNK , through _UNK and a whole _UNK , through the _UNK , the _UNK of _UNK , and all society ( except the _UNK ) , the bier _UNK descended to the Common _UNK : who , in pursuance of the _UNK , was required to _UNK " _UNK , powdered , in a gold-laced coat , d--me , and white silk stockings . " At the gallows and the _UNK _UNK was the _UNK suppression , as it was the _UNK mode among his brother _UNK of the _UNK , _UNK _UNK , and the rest , to call him , presided in this dainty dress . And who among the company at _UNK ' s reception in that seventeen hundred and _UNK year of our Lord , could possibly doubt , that the system _UNK in the _UNK _UNK , powdered , gold-laced , _UNK , and _UNK _UNK , would see the very stars out ! _UNK having eased his four men of their _UNK and taken his _UNK , caused the doors of the _UNK of _UNK to be thrown open , and issued forth . Then , what _UNK , what _UNK and _UNK , what _UNK , what shadowy _UNK ! As to bowing down in body and spirit , nothing in that way was left for _UNK may have been one among other reasons why the _UNK of _UNK never troubled it . originate a word of promise here and a smile there , a whisper on one happy _UNK and a wave of the hand on another , _UNK _UNK passed through his rooms to the remote region of the _UNK of , . There , _UNK turned , and came back again , and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his _UNK by the _UNK _UNK , and was seen no more . The show being over , the flutter in the air became quite a little _UNK , and a precious little _UNK went ringing downstairs . There was soon but one person left of all the crowd , and he , with his hat under his arm and his snuff-box in his hand , slowly passed among the _UNK on his way out . " I devote you , " said this person , stopping at the last door on his way , and turning in the direction of the _UNK , " to the Devil ! " With that , he shook a snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet , and quietly walked downstairs . He was the man of about _UNK , handsomely dressed , haughty in manner , and with the face like a fine mask . The face of the _UNK paleness ; every feature in it clearly defined ; one set expression on it . The nose , _UNK formed otherwise , was very slightly pinched at the top of each _UNK . In those two _UNK , or _UNK , the only little change that the face ever showed , resided . They , in changing colour sometimes , and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint _UNK ; then , they gave a look of treachery , and cruelty , to the whole countenance . _UNK with attention , its capacity of _UNK such a look was to be found in a line of the mouth , and the period of the _UNK of the eyes , being much too _UNK and thin ; still , in the effect of the face made , it was a handsome face , and a remarkable one . sobs owner went downstairs into the _UNK , got into his carriage , and drove away . Not many people had talked with him at the reception ; he had stood in the little space apart , and _UNK might have been warmer in his manner . It appeared , under the circumstances , rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses , and often to escaping from being run down . His man drove as if he were _UNK an enemy , and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face , or to the lips , of the master . The complaint had sometimes made itself audible , even in that deaf city and dumb age , that , in a narrow streets without _UNK , a fierce _UNK custom of hard driving endangered and _UNK a mere vulgar in the _UNK manner . But , few _UNK enough for that to think of it a second time , and , in this matter , as in all others , a common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could . With a wild _UNK and _UNK , and an themselves--gave _UNK of consideration not easy to be understood in these days , the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners , with women screaming before it , and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way . At last , _UNK at the street corner by the _UNK , one of its wheels came to the sickening little _UNK , and there was a loud cry from the number of voices , and the horses . and plunged . But for the latter inconvenience , the carriage probably would not have stopped ; _UNK were often known to drive on , and leave their wounded behind , and why not ? But the frightened _UNK had got down in a hurry , and there were twenty hands at the horses ' _UNK . " What has gone wrong ? " said _UNK , _UNK looking out . The tall man in the nightcap had caught up the bundle from among the feet of the horses , and had laid it on the _UNK of the _UNK , and was down in the mud and wet , howling over it like a wild animal . " _UNK , _UNK a _UNK ! " said the ragged and _UNK man , " it is a child . " " Why does he make that abominable noise ? Is it his child ? " " _UNK me , _UNK a _UNK is the _UNK . " A _UNK was the little removed ; for the street opened , where it was , into a space some ten or twelve yards square . As a tall man suddenly got up from the ground , and came running at the carriage , _UNK a _UNK clapped his hand for an instant on his _UNK . " _UNK ! " sixpences the man , in wild desperation , extending both arms at their length above his head , and staring at him . " Dead ! " The people closed round , and looked at _UNK the _UNK . There was nothing _UNK by a many eyes that looked at him but _UNK and eagerness ; there was no visible menacing or anger . Neither did the people say anything ; after the first cry , they had been silent , and they remained so . The voice of the _UNK man who had spoken , was flat and _UNK in its extreme _UNK . _UNK the _UNK ran his eyes over them all , as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes . He took out his purse . " It is extraordinary to me , " said he , " that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children . One or the other of you is for ever in the way . How do I know what injury you have done my horses . See ! Give him that . " He threw out a gold coin for the _UNK to pick up , and all the heads _UNK forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell . The tall man called out again with the most unearthly cry , " Dead ! " He was _UNK by the quick arrival of another man , for whom the rest made way . On seeing him , the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder , sobbing and crying , and pointing to the _UNK , where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle , and moving gently about it . They were as silent , however , as the men . " I know all , I know all , " said the last comer . " Be a brave man , my _UNK ! It is better for the poor little _UNK to die so , than to live . It has died in the moment without pain . say-- it have lived an hour as happily ? " " You are the philosopher , you there , " said the _UNK , smiling . " How do they call you ? " " They call me _UNK . " " Of what trade ? " " _UNK the _UNK , the of wine . " " _UNK up that , philosopher and the of wine , " said the _UNK , throwing him another gold coin , " and spend it as you will . The horses there ; are they right ? " magnificent _UNK to look at a assemblage the second time , _UNK the _UNK leaned back in his seat , and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had a broke some common thing , and had paid for it , and could afford to pay for it ; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by the coin flying into his carriage , and ringing on its floor . " Hold ! " said _UNK the _UNK . " Hold the horses ! Who threw that ? " He looked to the spot where _UNK the mysteries of wine had stood , the moment before ; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot , and the figure that stood beside him was a figure of a dark stout woman , ! . " You dogs ! " said the _UNK , but _UNK , and with an unchanged front , except as to a spots on his nose : " I would ride over any of you very willingly , and _UNK you from the earth . If I knew which rascal threw at the carriage , and if that _UNK were sufficiently near it , he should be crushed under the wheels . " So cowed was their condition , and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them , within the law and beyond it , that not a voice , or the hand , or even an eye was raised . inspect the men , not one . But a woman who stood usual looked up steadily , and looked the _UNK in the face . It was not for his dignity to notice it ; his contemptuous eyes passed over her , and over all the other rats ; and he leaned back in his seat again , and gave the word " Go on ! " He was driven on , and other _UNK came whirling by in quick Once ; the _UNK , the _UNK , the _UNK , a Doctor , the _UNK , the _UNK , the _UNK _UNK , the _UNK , the whole outcast _UNK in the bright continuous flow , came whirling by . The rats had crept out of their holes to look on , and they remained looking on for hours ; _UNK and police often passing between them and the spectacle , and making a _UNK behind which they slunk , and through which they peeped . The father had long ago taken up his bundle and _UNK himself away with it , when the women who had tended the bundle while it lay on a base of the _UNK , sat there watching the running of the water and a rolling of the side _UNK the one woman who had stood conspicuous , respiration , still _UNK on with the _UNK of _UNK . The water of the _UNK ran , the room-door river ran , the day ran into evening , so much life in the city ran into death according to rule , time and tide waited for no man , the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again , the bier _UNK was lighted up at supper , all things ran their course . _UNK . _UNK in the _UNK A beautiful landscape , with the corn bright in it , but not _UNK . _UNK of poor _UNK where corn should have been , _UNK of poor _UNK and _UNK , _UNK of most coarse _UNK _UNK for _UNK . On inanimate nature , as on the men and women who _UNK it , a tour tendency towards an appearance of _UNK _UNK dejected disposition to give up , and _UNK away . _UNK the _UNK in his travelling carriage ( which might have been lighter ) , conducted by four _UNK and two _UNK , _UNK up a steep hill . The emphasis on the countenance of _UNK a _UNK was no _UNK of his high breeding ; it was not from within ; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his _UNK setting sun . The _UNK struck so _UNK into a travelling carriage when it gained the _UNK , that its _UNK was steeped in _UNK . " It will die out , " said _UNK the _UNK , glancing at his hands , " directly . " In effect , the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment . When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the rag-merchant , and the carriage _UNK down hill , with a _UNK smell , in a cloud of dust , a red glow departed quickly ; the sun and a _UNK going down together , there was no glow left when the ; was taken off . But , there remained a broken country , bold and open , the little village at the bottom of the hill , a broad sweep and rise beyond it , the _UNK , the _UNK , the the for the chase , and the _UNK with the _UNK on it used as a prison . _UNK upon all these _UNK objects as the night drew on , the _UNK looked , with the air of one who was coming near home . A village had its one poor street , with its poor brewery , poor _UNK , poor tavern , poor _UNK for _UNK of _UNK , poor _UNK , all usual poor _UNK . It had its poor people too . All its people were poor , and many of them were sitting at their doors , _UNK spare onions and the like for supper , while many were at the _UNK , washing leaves , and _UNK , and any such small _UNK of the earth that could be eaten . _UNK signs of what made them poor , were not wanting ; the _UNK for a state , the _UNK for the church , the _UNK for the lord , _UNK local and _UNK general , were to be paid here and to be paid there , according to solemn inscription in the little village , until the wonder was , that there was any village left _UNK . _UNK children were to be seen , and no dogs . As to the men and women , their choice on earth was stated in the _UNK on the lowest terms that could _UNK it , down in a little village under the mill ; or _UNK and Death in a _UNK prison on the _UNK . _UNK by the _UNK in advance , and by a _UNK of his _UNK ' _UNK , which twined _UNK about their heads in the evening air , as if he came attended by the _UNK , _UNK the _UNK drew up in his travelling carriage at the _UNK gate . It was hard by the _UNK , and the _UNK suspended their operations to look at him . He looked at them , and saw in them , without knowing it , a slow sure _UNK down of _UNK face and figure , that was to make the _UNK of _UNK an English _UNK which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years . _UNK the _UNK cast his eyes over the _UNK faces that drooped before him , as the like of himself had drooped before _UNK of the _UNK the difference was , that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to _UNK the ivy _UNK of the roads joined the group . " Bring me the that fellow ! " said the _UNK to the _UNK . The fellow was brought , cap in hand , and the other fellows closed round to look and listen , in the manner of the people at the , _UNK . " I passed you on the road ? " " _UNK , it is true . I had the honour of being passed on the road . " " boy--a up the hill , and at the top of the hill , both ? " " _UNK , it is true . " " What did you look at , so fixedly ? " " _UNK , I looked at the man . " He stooped a little , and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the carriage . All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage . " What man , pig ? And why look there ? " " _UNK , _UNK ; he swung by the chain of the _UNK commons . " " Who ? " demanded a traveller . " _UNK , the man . " " May the Devil carry away these _UNK ! How do you call the man ? You know all the men of this part of the country . Who was he ? " " Your _UNK , _UNK ! He was not of this part of the country . Of all the days of my life , I never saw him . " " _UNK by the chain ? To be _UNK ? " " With your gracious permission , that was the wonder of it , _UNK . His head hanging _UNK this ! " He turned himself sideways to the carriage , and leaned back , with his face thrown up to the sky , and his head hanging down ; then recovered himself , _UNK with his cap , and made a bow . " What was he like ? " " _UNK , he was _UNK than the _UNK . All covered with dust , white as a _UNK , tall as the _UNK ! " The picture produced an services sensation in a little crowd ; but all eyes , without slumbered notes with other eyes , looked at _UNK the _UNK . Perhaps , to observe whether he had any _UNK on his . . " _UNK , you did well , " said the _UNK , _UNK _UNK that such _UNK were not to _UNK him , " to see the thief accompanying my carriage , and not open that great mouth of yours . Bah ! Put him aside , _UNK _UNK ! " _UNK _UNK was the _UNK , and some other _UNK functionary united ; he had come out with great _UNK to assist at this examination , and had held a examined by a _UNK of his arm in an official manner . " Bah ! Go aside ! " said _UNK _UNK . " _UNK hands on this stranger if he _UNK to the in your village to-night , and be sure that his business is honest , _UNK . " " _UNK , I am _UNK to devote myself to your orders . " " Did he run away , fellow ? --where is that _UNK ? " The _UNK was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends , pointing out the chain with his blue cap . Some half-dozen other particular friends _UNK of him out , and presented him breathless to _UNK the _UNK . " Did a man run away , _UNK , when we stopped for the ; ? " " _UNK , he _UNK himself over the _UNK , head first , as the person plunges into the river . " " See to it , _UNK . Go on ! " The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the wheels , like sheep ; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky to save their _UNK and bones ; they had very little else to save , or they might not have been so fortunate . A burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up a rise beyond , was soon checked by the _UNK of the hill . cheeks , it subsided to a foot pace , swinging and lumbering upward among a many sweet _UNK of the summer night . The _UNK , with the thousand _UNK _UNK _UNK about them in lieu of the _UNK , quietly mended the points to the _UNK of their _UNK ; the _UNK walked by the horses ; a _UNK was audible , _UNK on ahead into a dull distance . At the _UNK point of the hill there was a little _UNK , with a _UNK and a new large figure of _UNK , on it ; it was a poor figure in wood , done by some _UNK defending _UNK , but he had studied a figure from the _UNK own life , _UNK it was dreadfully spare and thin . To this _UNK _UNK of a great distress that had long been growing worse , and was not at its worst , the woman was kneeling . She turned her head as the carriage came up to her , rose quickly , and presented herself at the _UNK . " It is you , _UNK ! _UNK , the _UNK . " With an exclamation of impatience , but with his _UNK face , _UNK looked out . " How , then ! What is it ? meanly _UNK ! " " _UNK . For the love of a great God ! My husband , the _UNK . " " What of your husband , the _UNK ? assuming the same with you people . He cannot pay something ? " " He has paid all , _UNK . He is dead . " " Well ! He is quiet . teaspoon I restore him to you ? " " Alas , no , _UNK ! But he lies yonder , under the little heap of poor grass . " " Well ? " " _UNK , there are so many little heaps of poor grass ? " " Again , well ? " She looked an old woman , but was young . Her manner was one of passionate grief ; by turns she clasped her _UNK and knotted hands together with wild energy , and laid one of them on the _UNK , _UNK , as if it had been the human breast , and could be expected to feel the appealing touch . " _UNK , hear me ! _UNK , hear my _UNK ! My husband died of want ; so many die of want ; so many more will die of want . " " Again , well ? patted I feed them ? " " _UNK , the good God knows ; but I don ' t ask it . My _UNK is , that the morsel of stone or wood , with my husband ' s name , may be placed over him to show where he lies . _UNK , a place will be quickly forgotten , it will never be found when I am dead of the same _UNK , I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass . _UNK , they are so many , they increase so fast , there is so much want . _UNK ! _UNK ! " The _UNK had put her away from the door , the carriage had broken into a brisk trot , the _UNK had quickened a pace , she was left far behind , and _UNK , again escorted by the _UNK , was rapidly diminishing a _UNK or two of distance that remained between him and his _UNK . A sweet _UNK of a summer night rose all around him , and rose , as the rain ; , impartially , on the dusty , ragged , and _UNK group at the _UNK not far away ; to whom the _UNK of roads , with the aid of a blue cap without which he was nothing , still _UNK upon his man like a _UNK , as long as they could bear it . By degrees , as they could bear no more , they dropped off one by one , and lights _UNK in little _UNK ; which lights , as the _UNK darkened , and more stars came out , seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having been extinguished . The shadow of a large _UNK house , and of many _UNK trees , was upon _UNK the _UNK by that time ; and the shadow was exchanged for the light of the _UNK , as his carriage stopped , and a great door of his _UNK was opened to him . " _UNK Charles , whom I expect ; is he arrived from England ? " " _UNK , not yet . " _UNK . The _UNK ' s _UNK It was a heavy mass of building , that _UNK of _UNK the _UNK , with a large stone _UNK before it , and two stone _UNK of staircase meeting in a stone _UNK before the bolts door . A _UNK business altogether , with heavy stone _UNK , and stone _UNK , and stone flowers , and stone faces of men , and stone heads of _UNK , in all directions . As if the _UNK ' s head had surveyed it , when it was finished , two _UNK ago . notes a broad flight of the steps , _UNK a _UNK , _UNK preceded , went from his carriage , sufficiently _UNK the darkness to ; loud remonstrance from an _UNK in the roof of the great pursuance of _UNK building away among the trees . All else was so quiet , that the _UNK carried up the steps , and the other _UNK held at a great door , burnt as if they were in a close room of state , instead of being in the open _UNK . elevating sound than the _UNK ' s voice there was none , save the falling of the _UNK into its stone basin ; for , it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together , and then heave a long low sigh , and hold their breath again . The great door _UNK behind him , and _UNK the _UNK crossed the hall grim with certain old _UNK , _UNK , and _UNK of the chase ; _UNK with certain heavy _UNK and _UNK , of which many a _UNK , gone to his benefactor Death , had felt the weight when his lord was angry . inspect the _UNK rooms , which were dark and made fast for the night , _UNK a _UNK , with his _UNK going on before , went up the staircase to the door in the _UNK . This thrown open , admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms : his _UNK and two others . High _UNK rooms with cool _UNK , , great dogs upon the _UNK for a burning of wood in winter time , and all _UNK befitting a state of the _UNK in the _UNK age and country . The fashion of the last _UNK but one , of the line that was never to _UNK _UNK _UNK conspicuous in their rich furniture ; but , it was _UNK by many objects that were _UNK of old pages in a history of famine . A _UNK was laid for two , in the third of the rooms ; a round room , in one of the _UNK ' s four _UNK _UNK . A small lofty room , with its window wide open , and a wooden _UNK closed , so that the dark night only showed in slight _UNK boasts of black , _UNK with their broad boasts of stone colour . " My _UNK , " said the _UNK , glancing at the supper preparation ; " they said he was not arrived . " Nor was he ; but , he had been expected with _UNK . " Ah ! It is not probable he will arrive to-night ; nevertheless , leave the table as it is . I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour . " In a quarter of an hour _UNK was ready , and sat down alone to his _UNK and choice supper . His chair was opposite to the window , and he had taken his _UNK , and was raising his glass of _UNK to his lips , when he put it down . " What is that ? " he _UNK asked , looking with attention at the _UNK boasts of black and stone colour . " _UNK ? That ? " " ' a blinds . notes the blinds . " It was done . " Well ? " " _UNK , it is nothing . The trees and the night are all that are here . " The servant who spoke , had thrown the blinds wide , had looked out into the vacant darkness , and stood with that blank behind him , looking round for instructions . " Good , " said the _UNK master . " Close them again . " That was done too , and the _UNK went on with his supper . He was half way through it , when he again stopped with his glass in his hand , hearing the sound of wheels . It came on briskly , and came up to the front of the _UNK . " _UNK who is arrived . " It was the _UNK of _UNK . He had been some few _UNK behind _UNK , early in the afternoon . He had diminished the distance rapidly , but not so rapidly as to come up with _UNK on the road . He had heard of _UNK , at the _UNK , as being before him . He was to be told ( said _UNK ) that supper awaited him then and there , and that he was prayed to come to it . In a little while he came . He had been known in England as Charles _UNK . _UNK received him in the _UNK manner , but they did not shake hands . " You left it yesterday , sir ? " he said to _UNK , as he took his seat at table . " _UNK . And you ? " " I come direct . " " From London ? " " Yes . " " You have been a long time coming , " said the _UNK , with a smile . " On the contrary ; I come direct . " " _UNK me ! I mean , not a long time on the journey ; a long time _UNK the journey . " " I have been ' by " --the _UNK stopped the moment in his _UNK " various business . " " Without doubt , " said the polished uncle . So long as the servant was present , no other words passed between them . When coffee had been served and they were alone together , the _UNK , looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask , opened the conversation . " I have come back , sir , as you _UNK , pursuing the object that took me away . It carried me into great and unexpected peril ; but it is a sufficiency object , and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me . " " Not to death , " said the uncle ; " it is not necessary to say , to death . " " I doubt , sir , " returned the _UNK , " whether , if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death , you would have _UNK to stop me there . " The _UNK marks in the nose , and the _UNK of a fine straight period in the cruel face , looked _UNK as to that ; the uncle made a _UNK gesture of _UNK , which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not _UNK . " Indeed , sir , " pursued the _UNK , " for anything I know , you may have _UNK worked to give the more suspicious appearance to a suspicious circumstances that surrounded me . " " No , no , no , " said the uncle , pleasantly . " But , however that may be , " resumed the _UNK , glancing at him with deep tears , " I know that your _UNK would stop me by any means , and would know no scruple as to means . " " My friend , I told you so , " said the uncle , with a fine _UNK in the two marks . " Do me the favour to recall that I told you so , long ago . " " I recall it . " " Thank you , " said the _UNK _UNK indeed . His tone lingered in the air , almost like a tone of a musical instrument . " In effect , sir , " pursued the _UNK , " I believe it to be at once your bad fortune , and my good fortune , that has kept me out of a prison in the here . " " I do not quite understand , " returned the uncle , sipping his coffee . " _UNK I ask you to explain ? " " I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the _UNK , and had not been _UNK by that cloud for years past , the letter water--and _UNK would have sent me to some _UNK _UNK . " " It is possible , " said the uncle , with great calmness . " For the honour of the family , I could even resolve to _UNK you to that extent . Pray excuse me ! " " I _UNK that , happily for me , the _UNK of the day before yesterday was , as usual , a cold one , " observed a _UNK . " I would not say happily , my friend , " returned the uncle , with refined politeness ; " I would not be sure of that . A good opportunity for consideration , surrounded by the advantages of solitude , might influence your _UNK to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself . But it is useless to discuss the question . I am , as you say , at the disadvantage . These little _UNK of correction , these gentle _UNK to the power and honour of families , these slight favours that might so _UNK you , are only to be obtained now by interest and _UNK . They are sought by so many , and they are granted ( comparatively ) to so few ! It used not to be so , but hotel in all such things is changed for the worse . _UNK not remote _UNK held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar . From this room , many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged ; in the next room ( my bedroom ) , one fellow , to our knowledge , was _UNK on the spot for _UNK some insolent _UNK _UNK his _UNK daughter ? We have lost many , ; the new philosophy has become the mode ; and the amiability of our station , in these days , might ( I do not go so far as to say would , but might ) cause us real inconvenience . All very bad , very bad ! " The _UNK took a gentle little pinch of snuff , and shook his head ; as _UNK _UNK as he could _UNK be of the country still impudent himself , that great means of _UNK . " We have so asserted our station , both in the old time and in a modern time also , " said the _UNK , _UNK , " that I believe our name to be more , than any name in the . " " Let us hope so , " said the uncle . " _UNK of the high is the involuntary _UNK of the low . " " There is not , " pursued the _UNK , in his former tone , " the face I can look at , in all this country round about us , which looks at me with any deference on it but a dark deference of fear and _UNK . " " A compliment , " said the _UNK , " to the handle of the family , joined by the manner in which the family has sustained its . . merry-go-rounder ! " And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff , and lightly crossed his legs . But , when his _UNK , leaning an elbow on the table , covered his eyes a and dejectedly with his hand , a fine mask looked at him sideways with the stronger _UNK of _UNK , closeness , and dislike , than was _UNK with its wearer ' s assumption of indifference . " _UNK is the only lasting philosophy . A dark deference of fear and _UNK , my friend , " observed a _UNK , " will keep the dogs obedient to a scullery , as long as this roof , " looking up to it , " _UNK out the sky . " That might not be so long as the _UNK supposed . If the picture of the _UNK as it was to be a very few years Except , and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years Except , could have been shown to him that night , he might have been at a loss to claim his own from a ghastly , _UNK , _UNK _UNK . As for a roof he _UNK , he might have found , shutting out the sky in a new _UNK wit , for ever , from the eyes of a bodies into which its lead was fired , out of the _UNK of a hundred thousand _UNK . " Meanwhile , " said the _UNK , " I will preserve the honour and repose of the family , if you will not . But you must be fatigued . Shall we _UNK our conference for the night ? " " A moment more . " " An hour , if you please . " " _UNK , " said the _UNK , " we have done wrong , and are _UNK the _UNK of wrong . " " _UNK have done wrong ? " repeated the _UNK , with an inquiring smile , and _UNK pointing , first to his _UNK , then to himself . " _UNK family ; our honourable family , whose honour is of so much account to both of us , in such different ways . killed in my father ' s time , we did the world of wrong , _UNK every human creature who came between us and our pleasure , whatever it was . Why need I speak of my father ' s time , when it is equally yours ? patted I separate my father ' s _UNK , joint _UNK , and next _UNK , from himself ? " " Death has done that ! " said the _UNK . " And has left me , " answered the _UNK , " bound to the system that is frightful to me , responsible for it , but in in it ; seeking to execute the last request of my dear mother ' s lips , and obey the last look of my dear mother ' s eyes , which chucks me to have mercy and to the ; and hailed by seeking assistance and power in vain . " " _UNK them from me , my _UNK , " said the _UNK , touching him on the breast with his _UNK were now standing by the _UNK " you will for ever seek them in vain , be assured . " Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face , was _UNK , craftily , and closely compressed , while he stood looking quietly at his _UNK , with his snuff-box in his hand . Once again he touched him on the breast , as though his finger were a fine point of a small _UNK , with which , in delicate _UNK , he ran him through the body , and said , " My friend , I will die , _UNK the system under which I have lived . " When he had said it , he took a _UNK pinch of snuff , and put his box in his pocket . " Better to be a rational creature , " he added then , after ringing a small bell on the table , " and accept your natural _UNK . But you are lost , _UNK Charles , I see . " " This property and the are lost to me , " said the _UNK , sadly ; " I _UNK them . " " Are they both yours to _UNK ? a may be , but is the property ? It is scarcely worth mentioning ; but , is it yet ? " " I had no intention , in the words I used , to claim it yet . If it passed to me from you , _UNK " " Which I have a _UNK to hope is not probable . " " _UNK twenty years _UNK " " You do me too much honour , " said the _UNK ; " still , I prefer that supposition . " " --I would the it , and live otherwise and elsewhere . It is little to _UNK . What is it but the _UNK of misery and , ! " " Hah ! " said the _UNK , glancing round the _UNK room . " To the eye it is fair enough , here ; but seen in its _UNK , under the sky , and by a daylight , it is the decisive capable of , , _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , hunger , _UNK , and suffering . " " Hah ! " said the _UNK again , in the _UNK manner . " If it ever becomes mine , it shall be put into some hands better streamed to free it slowly ( if such a thing is possible ) from the weight that _UNK it down , so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who have been long wrung to the last point of , , may , in another _UNK , suffer less ; but it is not for me . There is a curse on it , and on all this cellar . " " And you ? " said the uncle . " Forgive my curiosity ; do you , under your new philosophy , graciously intend to live ? " " I must do , to live , what others of my verdict , even with _UNK at their backs , may have to do some _UNK . " " In England , for example ? " " Yes . The family honour , sir , is safe from me in this country . The family name can suffer from me in no other , for I bear it in no other . " The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining _UNK to be lighted . It now shone brightly , through the door of communication . The _UNK looked that way , and listened for a retreating step of his _UNK . " England is very ' to you , seeing how _UNK you have prospered there , " he observed then , turning his calm face to his _UNK with a smile . " I have already said , that for my _UNK there , I am _UNK I may be _UNK to you , sir . For the rest , it is my _UNK . " " They say , those _UNK English , that it is a _UNK of many . You know the _UNK who has found the _UNK there ? A Doctor ? " " Yes . " " With the daughter ? " " Yes . " " Yes , " said the _UNK . " You are fatigued . Good night ! " As he bent his head in his most _UNK manner , there was the secrecy in his smiling face , and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words , which struck the eyes and ears of his _UNK forcibly . At the same time , the thin straight boasts of the setting of the eyes , and the thin straight lips , and the _UNK in the nose , _UNK with a sarcasm that looked handsomely _UNK . " Yes , " repeated the _UNK . " A Doctor with a daughter . Yes . So _UNK a new philosophy ! You are fatigued . Good night ! " It would have been of as much avail to _UNK any stone face outside the _UNK as to _UNK that face of his . The _UNK looked at him , in vain , in passing on to the door . " Good night ! " said the uncle . " I look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning . Good repose ! feverishly _UNK my _UNK to his chamber there ! _UNK burn _UNK my _UNK in his bed , if you will , " he added to himself , before he rang his little bell again , and summoned his _UNK to his own bedroom . The _UNK come and gone , _UNK the _UNK walked to and fro in his loose _UNK , to prepare himself gently for sleep , that hot still night . _UNK about the room , his _UNK feet making no noise on the floor , he moved like a waggish _UNK : _UNK like some _UNK _UNK of the _UNK wicked sort , in story , whose periodical change into _UNK form was either just going off , or just coming on . He moved from end to end of his _UNK bedroom , looking again at the _UNK of the day ' s journey that came crawled into his mind ; a slow toil up the hill at _UNK , a setting sun , the _UNK , the mill , a prison on the _UNK , a little village in the hollow , a _UNK at the _UNK , and the _UNK of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage . That _UNK suggested the , _UNK , the little bundle lying on the step , the women bending over it , and a tall man with his arms up , crying , " Dead ! " " I am cool now , " said _UNK a _UNK , " and may go to bed . " So , leaving only one light burning on a large hearth , he let his thin _UNK curtains fall around him , and heard the night break its silence with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep . The stone faces on the outer walls stared _UNK at a black night for three heavy hours ; for three heavy hours , the horses in the handle rattled at their _UNK , the dogs _UNK , and the _UNK made the noise with very little resemblance in it to a noise _UNK assigned to the _UNK by _UNK . But it is a obstinate custom of such creatures hardly ever to say what is set down for them . For three heavy hours , a stone faces of the _UNK , _UNK and human , stared _UNK at the night . moodily darkness lay on all the landscape , dead darkness added its own hush to the _UNK dust on all the painting . The _UNK had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were _UNK from one another ; a figure on the _UNK might have come down , for anything that could be seen of it . In the village , _UNK and _UNK were fast asleep . _UNK , perhaps , of _UNK , as a starved usually do , and of ease and rest , as the driven _UNK and a _UNK _UNK may , its lean inhabitants slept house-tops , and were fed and freed . The _UNK in the village _UNK unseen and _UNK , and a _UNK at the _UNK dropped unseen and _UNK _UNK away , like the minutes that were falling from the spring of _UNK three dark hours . Then , a ' water of both began to be _UNK in the light , and the eyes of a stone faces of the _UNK were opened . _UNK and lighter , until at last the sun touched the region of the still trees , and poured its _UNK over the hill . In a glow , the water of the _UNK _UNK seemed to turn to blood , and a stone faces _UNK . The _UNK of the birds was loud and high , and , on the _UNK _UNK of a great window of the _UNK of _UNK the _UNK , one little bird sang its _UNK song with all its might . At this , the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed , and , with open mouth and dropped brooches , looked corroboration . Now , the sun was full up , and the began in the village . _UNK windows opened , crazy doors were unbarred , and people came forth _UNK , as yet , by a new sweet air . Then began the _UNK _UNK toil of the day among the village population . Some , to the _UNK ; some , to the fields ; men and women here , to _UNK and _UNK ; men and women there , to see to a poor live stock , and lead a bony _UNK out , to such _UNK as could be found by the _UNK . In a church and at the _UNK , the kneeling figure or two ; attendant on the latter prayers , the led _UNK , trying for the breakfast among the ' at its foot . The _UNK awoke later , as became its suppression , but awoke gradually and surely . leader , the lonely _UNK and _UNK of the chase had been _UNK as of old ; then , had gleamed _UNK in the morning sunshine ; now , doors and windows were thrown open , horses in their successive looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways , leaves _UNK and rustled at _UNK windows , dogs pulled hard at their _UNK , and . impatient to be _UNK . All these trivial _UNK belonged to the _UNK of life , and the return of morning . guard , not so the ringing of a great bell of the _UNK , nor a running up and down the stairs ; nor the hurried figures on the _UNK ; nor the _UNK and _UNK here and there and courts , nor a quick _UNK of horses and _UNK away ? What winds conveyed this hurry to the fool--I _UNK of roads , already at work on the _UNK beyond the village , with his day ' s dinner ( not much to carry ) lying in the bundle that it was worth no crow ' s while to _UNK at , on a heap of WHICH ? _UNK the birds , carrying some grains of it to the distance , dropped one over him as they _UNK chance , ? Whether or no , the _UNK of roads ran , on a sultry morning , as if for his life , down the hill , _UNK in dust , and never stopped till he got to the _UNK . All the people of the village were at the _UNK , standing about in their depressed manner , and whispering low , but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise . The led _UNK , hastily brought in and _UNK to anything that would hold them , were looking marched on , or lying down _UNK the _UNK of nothing particularly _UNK their trouble , which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter . Some of the people of the _UNK , and some of those of the _UNK , and all a _UNK authorities , were _UNK more or less , and were crowded on the other side of the little street in the _UNK way , that was highly _UNK with nothing . _UNK , the _UNK of roads had ' into the midst of the group of fifty particular friends , and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap . What did all this _UNK , and what _UNK the gutter _UNK of _UNK _UNK behind the servant on horseback , and the _UNK away of the said _UNK ( _UNK though a horse was ) , at the ; , like a new _UNK of the _UNK ballad of _UNK ? It _UNK that there was one stone face too many , up at the _UNK . A _UNK had surveyed the building again in the night , and had added a one stone face wanting ; a stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years . It lay back on the pillow of _UNK the _UNK . It was like a fine mask , suddenly startled , made angry , and _UNK . _UNK home into the heart of a stone figure attached to it , was a knife . _UNK its _UNK was the frill of paper , on which was _UNK : " Drive him fast to his of . This , from _UNK . " _UNK . Two _UNK More months , to the number of twelve , had come and gone , and Mr . Charles _UNK was established in England as a higher _UNK of a French _UNK who was _UNK with French literature . In this age , he would have been the _UNK ; in that age , he was a _UNK . He read with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a living tongue spoken all over the world , and he _UNK a taste for its stores of knowledge and fancy . He could write of them , besides , in sound English , and render them into sound English . Such masters were not at that time easily found ; _UNK that had been , and _UNK that were to be , were not yet of the _UNK class , and no grains _UNK had dropped out of _UNK ' s _UNK , to turn _UNK and assumed . As the _UNK , whose _UNK made a _UNK ' s way unusually pleasant and profitable , and as an elegant _UNK who brought something to his work besides mere _UNK knowledge , young Mr . _UNK soon became known and encouraged . He was well acquainted , _UNK , with the circumstances of his country , and those were of _UNK interest . So , with great _UNK and the _UNK , he prospered . In London , he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold , nor to lie on beds of roses ; if he had had any such exalted expectation , he would not have prospered . He had expected labour , and he found it , and did it and made the best of it . In this , his _UNK consisted . A certain portion of his time was passed at _UNK , where he read with _UNK as the sort of _UNK _UNK who drove the _UNK trade in _UNK _UNK , instead of _UNK _UNK and _UNK through the _UNK . A rest of his time he passed in London . Now , from the days when it was always summer in _UNK , to these days when it is _UNK winter in fallen _UNK , the world of a man has invariably gone one _UNK _UNK ' s _UNK way of the love of the woman . He had loved _UNK _UNK from the hour of his danger . He had never heard the sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her enormous voice ; he had never seen the face so tenderly beautiful , as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been _UNK for him . But , he had not yet spoken to her on the subject ; the _UNK at the deserted _UNK far away beyond the gratification water and a long , long , dusty _UNK _UNK stone _UNK which had itself become a mere mist of the _UNK been done the year , and he had never yet , by so much as the single spoken word , disclosed to her a state of his heart . That he had his reasons for this , he knew full well . It was again the summer day when , lately arrived in London from his _UNK occupation , he turned into the quiet corner in _UNK , bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to Doctor _UNK . It was the close of the summer day , and he knew _UNK to be out with Miss _UNK . He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at the window . A energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness , had been gradually restored to him . He was now a very _UNK man indeed , with great firmness of purpose , strength of resolution , and vigour of action . In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little _UNK and sudden , as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered _UNK ; but , this had never been frequently observable , and had grown more and more rare . He studied much , slept little , sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease , and was _UNK cheerful . To him , now entered Charles _UNK , at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand . " Charles _UNK ! I _UNK to see you . We have been counting on your return these three or four days past . Mr . _UNK and _UNK _UNK were both here yesterday , and both made you out to be more than due . " " I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter , " he answered , the little coldly as to them , though very warmly as to the Doctor . " Miss _UNK " " Is well , " said the Doctor , as he stopped short , " and your return will delight us all . She has gone out on some _UNK matters , but will soon be home . " " Doctor _UNK , I knew she was from home . I took the opportunity of her being from home , to beg to speak to you . " There was the blank silence . " Yes ? " said the Doctor , with evident assumed . " Bring your chair here , and speak on . " He complied as to a chair , but appeared to find a speaking on less easy . " I have had the happiness , ' _UNK , of being so intimate here , " so he at length began , " for some year and a half , that I hope a _UNK on which I am about to touch may not-- " He was _UNK by a Doctor ' s putting out his hand to stop him . When he had kept it so a little while , he said , drawing it back : " Is _UNK the _UNK ? " " She is . " " It is hard for me to speak of her at any time . It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours , Charles _UNK . " " It is the tone of fervent admiration , true _UNK , and deep love , ' _UNK ! " he said deferentially . There was another blank silence before her father rejoined : " I believe it . I do you justice ; I believe it . " His shroud was so _UNK , and it was so _UNK , too , that it originated in an _UNK to approach the subject , that Charles _UNK hesitated . " Shall I go on , sir ? " Another blank . " Yes , go on . " " You _UNK what I would say , though you cannot know how earnestly I say it , how earnestly I feel it , without knowing my secret heart , and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden . Dear Doctor _UNK , I love your daughter . , dearly , _UNK , devotedly . If ever there were love in the world , I love her . You have loved yourself ; let your old love speak for me ! " The Doctor sat with his face turned away , and his eyes bent on the ground . At the last words , he stretched out his hand again , hurriedly , and cried : " Not that , sir ! Let that be ! I _UNK you , do not recall that ! " His cry was so like a cry of actual pain , that it rang in Charles _UNK ' s ears long after he had ceased . He motioned with the hand he had extended , and it seemed to be an appeal to _UNK to pause . The latter so received it , and remained silent . " I ask your pardon , " said a Doctor , in a subdued tone , after some moments . " I do not doubt your loving _UNK ; you may be satisfied of it . " He turned towards him in his chair , but did not look at him , or raise his eyes . His chin dropped upon his hand , and his white hair _UNK his face : " Have you spoken to _UNK ? " " No . " " Nor written ? " " Never . " " It would be _UNK to affect not to know that your _UNK is to be referred to your consideration for her father . Her father thanks you . " He offered his hand ; but his eyes did not go with it . " I know , " said _UNK , respectfully , " how can I fail to know , ' _UNK , I who have seen you together from day to day , that between you and Miss _UNK there is an affection so unusual , so touching , so _UNK to the circumstances in which it has been _UNK , that it can have few _UNK , even in a tenderness between the father and child . I know , ' _UNK can I fail to _UNK , mingled with the affection and duty of the daughter who has become a woman , there is , in her heart , towards you , all the love and _UNK of infancy itself . I know that , as in her childhood she had no stem , so she is now devoted to you with all the _UNK and fervour of her present years and character , united to the _UNK and attachment of a early days in which you were lost to her . I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life , you could hardly be _UNK , in her sight , with a more calves character than that in which you are always with her . I know that when she is clinging to you , the hands of baby , girl , and woman , all in one , are round your neck . I know that in loving you she sees and disorder her mother at her own age , sees and mission you at my age , guided her mother _UNK , guided you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed _UNK . I have known this , night and day , since I have known you in your home . " Her father sat silent , with his face bent down . His ' was a little quickened ; but he was all other signs of agitation . " Dear Doctor _UNK , always knowing this , always seeing her and you with this open-hearted light about you , I have _UNK , and _UNK , as long as it was in the nature of man to do it . I have felt , and do even now feel , that to bring my _UNK _UNK you , is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself . But I love her . Heaven is my witness that I love her ! " " I believe it , " answered her father , mournfully . " I have thought so before now . I believe it . " " But , do not believe , " said _UNK , upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a _UNK sound , " that if my fortune were so cast as that , being one day so happy as to make her my wife , I must at any time put any separation between her and you , I could or would breathe a word of what I now say . Besides that I should know it to be hopeless , I should know it to be a _UNK . If I had any such possibility , even at a remote distance of years , _UNK in my thoughts , and hidden in my _UNK it ever had been _UNK it ever could be _UNK could not now touch this honoured hand . " He laid his own upon it as he spoke . " No , dear Doctor _UNK . Like you , the voluntary _UNK from the ; like you , driven from it by its distractions , _UNK , and the ; like you , striving to live away from it by my own exertions , and reposed in a happier future ; I look only to _UNK your fortunes , _UNK your life and home , and being faithful to you to the death . Not to forefinger with _UNK her _UNK as your child , companion , and friend ; but to come in aid of it , and bind her closer to you , if such a thing can be . " His touch still lingered on her father ' s hand . _UNK a touch for a moment , but not coldly , her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair , and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference . A struggle was evidently in his face ; the struggle with that _UNK look which had the tendency in it to dark doubt and dread . " You speak so _UNK and so _UNK , Charles _UNK , that I thank you with all my heart , and will open all my _UNK nearly so . Have you any reason to believe that _UNK mission you ? " " None . As yet , none . " " Is it the immediate object of this confidence , that you may at once ascertain that , with my knowledge ? " " Not even so . I might not have the _UNK to do it for weeks ; I might ( mistaken or not mistaken ) have that _UNK to-morrow . " " Do you seek any _UNK from me ? " " I ask none , sir . But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power , if you should deem it right , to give me some . " " Do you seek any promise from me ? " " I do seek that . " " What is it ? " " I well understand that , without you , I could have no hope . I well understand that , even if Miss _UNK held me at this moment in her innocent _UNK not think I have a _UNK to assume so _UNK could forward--in no place in it against her love for her father . " " If that be so , do you see what , on the other hand , is involved in it ? " " I understand equally well , that a word from her father in any _UNK ' s favour , would _UNK herself and all the world . For which reason , ' _UNK , " said _UNK , modestly but firmly , " I would not ask that word , to save my life . " " I am sure of it . Charles _UNK , replied arise out of close love , as well as out of wide _UNK ; in the former case , they are subtle and delicate , and difficult to penetrate . My daughter _UNK is , in this one respect , such a mystery to me ; I can make no guess at a state of her heart . " " May I ask , sir , if you think she _UNK " As he hesitated , her father supplied the rest . " Is sought by any other _UNK ? " " It is what I meant to say . " Her father considered a little before he answered : " You have seen Mr . _UNK here , yourself . Mr . _UNK is here too , occasionally . If it be at all , it can only be by one of these . " " Or both , " said _UNK . " I had not thought of both ; I should not think either , likely . You want a promise from me . Tell me what it is . " " It is , that if Miss _UNK should bring to you at any time , on her own part , such the confidence as I have ventured to lay before you , you will bear testimony to what I have said , and to your belief in it . I hope you may be able to think so well of me , as to urge no influence against me . I say nothing more of my stake in this ; this is what I ask . The condition on which I ask it , and which you have an undoubted right to require , I will observe immediately . " " I give a promise , " said the Doctor , " without any condition . I believe your object to be , _UNK and _UNK , as you have stated it . I believe your intention is to _UNK , and not to _UNK , the _UNK between me and my other and far _UNK self . If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness , I will give her to you . If there _UNK _UNK , if there _UNK " The young man had taken his hand _UNK ; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke : " _UNK , , any reasons , any apprehensions , anything whatsoever , new or old , against a man she really _UNK direct responsibility thereof not lying on his _UNK should all be obliterated for her sake . She is everything to me ; more to me than suffering , more to me than wrong , more to _UNK ! This is idle talk . " So strange was the way in which he faded into silence , and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak , that _UNK felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it . " You said something to me , " said Doctor _UNK , breaking into a smile . " What was it you said to me ? " He was at a loss how to answer , until he remembered having spoken of the condition . _UNK as his mind _UNK to that , he answered : " Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part . My present name , though but slightly changed from my mother ' s , is not , as you will remember , my own . I wish to tell you what that is , and why I am in England . " " Stop ! " said the Doctor of _UNK . " I wish it , that I may the better deserve your confidence , and have no secret from you . " " Stop ! " For an instant , the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears ; for another instant , even had his two hands laid on _UNK ' s lips . " Tell me when I ask you , not now . If your suit should prosper , if _UNK should love you , you shall tell me on your craftily morning . Do you promise ? " " _UNK . " Give me your hand . She will be home directly , and it is better she should not see us together to-night . Go ! God bless you ! " It was dark when Charles _UNK left him , and it was an hour later and the when _UNK came home ; she hurried into the room _UNK Miss _UNK had gone straight _UNK was surprised to find his _UNK empty . " My father ! " she called to him . " _UNK dear ! " Nothing was said in answer , but she heard a low earthy-smelling sound in his bedroom . _UNK lightly across the _UNK room , she looked in at his door and came running back frightened , crying to herself , with her blood all chilled , " What shall I do ! What shall I do ! " Her holds NANCY but the moment ; she hurried back , and tapped at his door , and softly called to him . A noise ceased at the sound of her voice , and he presently came out to her , and they walked up and down together for a long time . She came down from her bed , to look at him in his sleep that night . He slept heavily , and his tray of _UNK tools , and his old unfinished work , were all as usual . _UNK . A _UNK _UNK " _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , on that self-same night , or morning , to his _UNK ; " mix another bowl of _UNK ; I have something to say to you . " _UNK had been working double _UNK that night , and the night before , and the night before that , and a good many nights in and , making a _UNK _UNK among Mr . _UNK ' s papers before the setting in of a long _UNK . The _UNK was cheaper at last ; the _UNK arrears were handsomely fetched up ; everything was got rid of until _UNK should come with its _UNK _UNK , and _UNK legal , and bring _UNK to the mill again . _UNK was none the livelier and none the _UNK for so much application . It had taken a deal of extra _UNK to pull him through the night ; a _UNK extra quantity of wine had preceded the _UNK ; and he was in a very damaged condition , as he now pulled his _UNK off and threw it into a basin in which he had steeped it at intervals for the last six hours . " Are you mixing that other bowl of _UNK ? " said _UNK a portly , with his hands in his _UNK , glancing round from a sofa where he lay on his back . " I am . " " Now , look here ! I am going to tell you something that will rather surprise you , and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as shrewd as you usually do think me . I intend to marry . " " _UNK you ? " " Yes . And not for money . What do you say now ? " " I don ' t feel disposed to say much . Who is she ? " " _UNK . " " Do I know her ? " " _UNK . " " I am not going to guess , at five o ' clock in the morning , with my brains _UNK and _UNK in my head . If you want me to guess , you must ask me to dinner . " " Well then , I ' ll tell you , " said _UNK , coming slowly into a sitting posture . " _UNK , I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you , because you are such an insensible dog . " " And you , " returned _UNK , busy _UNK the _UNK , " are such a sensitive and _UNK _UNK " " Come ! " rejoined _UNK , laughing _UNK , " though I don ' t prefer any claim to being a soul of _UNK ( for I hope I know better ) , still I am the tenderer sort of fellow than _you_ . " " You are the _UNK , if you mean that . " " I don ' t mean that . I mean I am the man of _UNK " " Say obstinit , while you are about it , " suggested _UNK . " Well ! I ' ll say hallowed . My meaning is that I am the man , " said _UNK , _UNK himself at his friend as he made the _UNK , " who cares more to be agreeable , who takes more pains to be agreeable , who knows better how to be agreeable , in a woman ' s society , than you do . " " Go on , " said _UNK _UNK . " No ; but before I go on , " said _UNK , shaking his head in his bullying way , " I ' ll have this out with you . You ' ve been at Doctor _UNK ' s house as much as I have , or more than I have . Why , I have been ashamed of your _UNK there ! Your manners have been of that silent and confronted and _UNK kind , that , upon my life and soul , I have been ashamed of you , _UNK ! " " It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar , to be ashamed of anything , " returned _UNK ; " you ought to be much obliged to me . " " You shall not get off in that way , " rejoined _UNK , _UNK a rejoinder at him ; " no , _UNK , it ' s my duty to tell _UNK I tell you to your face to do you _UNK you are the . ill-conditioned fellow in that sort of society . You are a disagreeable fellow . " _UNK drank the _UNK of the _UNK he had made , and laughed . " Look at me ! " said _UNK , _UNK himself ; " I have less need to make myself agreeable than you have , being more independent in circumstances . Why do I do it ? " " I never saw you do it yet , " muttered _UNK . " I do it because it ' s _UNK ; I do it on principle . And look at me ! I get on . " " You don ' t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions , " answered _UNK , with the careless air ; " I wish you would keep to that . As to _UNK you never understand that I am incorrigible ? " He asked the question with some appearance of scorn . " You have no business to be incorrigible , " was his friend ' s answer , delivered in no very soothing tone . " I have no business to be , at all , that I know of , " said _UNK _UNK . " Who is the lady ? " " Now , don ' t let my _UNK of the name make you uncomfortable , _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , preparing him with _UNK friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make , " because I know you don ' t mean half you say ; and if you meant it all , it would be of no importance . I make this little preface , because you once mentioned the young lady to me in _UNK terms . " " I did ? " " Certainly ; and in these knuckles . " _UNK _UNK looked at his _UNK and looked at his complacent friend ; drank his _UNK and looked at his complacent friend . " You made mention of the young lady as the _UNK _UNK . The young lady is Miss _UNK . If you had been the fellow of any _UNK or _UNK of feeling in that kind of way , _UNK , I might have been a little _UNK of your employing such a designation ; but you are not . You want that sense altogether ; therefore I am no more _UNK when I think of the expression , than I should be _UNK by a man ' s opinion of the picture of mine , who had no eye for pictures : or of the piece of music of mine , who had no ear for music . " _UNK _UNK drank the _UNK at a great rate ; drank it by _UNK , looking at his friend . " Now you know all about it , _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK . " I don ' t care about fortune : she is a charming creature , and I have made up my mind to please myself : on the whole , I think I can afford to please myself . She will have in me a man already pretty well off , and a rapidly rising man , and a man of some marshy : it is a piece of good fortune for her , but she is worthy of good fortune . Are you astonished ? " _UNK , still drinking the _UNK , rejoined , " Why should I be astonished ? " " You approve ? " _UNK , still drinking the _UNK , rejoined , " Why should I not approve ? " " Well ! " said his friend _UNK , " you take it more easily than I fancied you would , and are less _UNK on my behalf than I thought you would be ; though , to be sure , you know well enough by this time that your Near _UNK is a man of a pretty strong will . Yes , _UNK , I have had enough of this style of life , with no other as the change from it ; I feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it ( when he doesn ' t , he can stay away ) , and I feel that Miss _UNK will tell well in any station , and will always do me credit . So I have made up my mind . And now , _UNK , old boy , I want to say a word to _you_ about _UNK prospects . You are in a bad way , you know ; you really are in a bad way . You don ' t know a value of money , you live hard , you ' ll knock up one of these days , and be ill and poor ; you really ought to think about the nurse . " The _UNK patronage with which he said it , made him look twice as big as he was , and four times as , . " Now , let me recommend you , " pursued _UNK , " to look it in the face . I have looked it in the face , in my different way ; look it in the face , you , in your different way . _UNK . _UNK somebody to take care of you . Never mind your having no _UNK of women ' s society , nor understanding of it , nor _UNK for it . tin out somebody . tin out some respectable woman with a little _UNK in the gilt-edged way , or _UNK _UNK marry her , against the rainy day . That ' s a kind of thing for _you_ . Now think of it , _UNK . " " I ' ll think of it , " said _UNK . _UNK . A _UNK of _UNK Mr . _UNK having made up his mind to that _UNK bestowal of good fortune on the Doctor ' s daughter , resolved to make her happiness known to her before he left town for a Long _UNK . After some mental _UNK of the point , he came to the conclusion that it would be as well to get all the preliminaries done with , and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two before _UNK _UNK , or in the little Christmas _UNK between it and _UNK . As to the strength of his case , he had not the doubt about it , but clearly saw his way to a verdict . _UNK with a jury on substantial BETWEEN _UNK only grounds ever worth taking into _UNK was a plain case , and had not a weak spot in it . He called himself for the _UNK , there was no getting over his evidence , a counsel for a _UNK threw up his brief , and a jury did not even turn to consider . After trying it , _UNK , _UNK . _UNK . , was satisfied that no _UNK case could be . whist , Mr . _UNK _UNK a Long _UNK with a formal proposal to take Miss _UNK to _UNK _UNK ; that failing , to _UNK ; that _UNK failing too , it _UNK him to present himself in _UNK , and there declare his noble mind . Towards _UNK , therefore , Mr . _UNK shouldered his way from the _UNK , while the bloom of the Long _UNK ' s infancy was still upon it . wicket-gate who had seen him projecting himself into _UNK while he was yet on Saint _UNK ' s side of _UNK Bar , bursting in his _UNK way along the pavement , to the _UNK of all _UNK people , might have seen how safe and strong he was . His way taking him past _UNK ' s , and he both _UNK at _UNK ' s and knowing Mr . _UNK as a intimate friend of the _UNK , it entered Mr . _UNK ' s mind to enter a bank , and finally to Mr . _UNK the brightness of the _UNK _UNK . So , he pushed open the door with a weak _UNK in its throat , stumbled down the two steps , got past the two unwillingly _UNK , and shouldered himself into the _UNK back closet where Mr . _UNK sat at great books _UNK for figures , with _UNK iron bars to his window as if that were _UNK for figures too , and everything under the clouds were the sum . " Halloa ! " said Mr . _UNK . " How do you do ? I hope you are well ! " It was _UNK ' s _UNK _UNK that he always seemed too big for any place , or space . He was so much too big for _UNK ' s , that old _UNK in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance , as though he squeezed them against the wall . The House itself , _UNK reading the paper quite in the _UNK perspective , lowered _UNK , as if the _UNK head had been _UNK into its responsible waistcoat . The discreet Mr . _UNK said , in the _UNK tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances , " How do you do , Mr . _UNK ? How do you do , sir ? " and shook hands . There was the _UNK in his manner of shaking hands , always to be seen in any clerk at _UNK ' s who shook hands with the customer when the House pervaded the air . He shook in the _UNK way , as one who shook for _UNK and _UNK . " Can I do anything for you , Mr . _UNK ? " asked Mr . _UNK , in his business character . " Why , no , thank you ; this is a private visit to yourself , Mr . _UNK ; I have come for a private word . " " Oh indeed ! " said Mr . _UNK , bending down his ear , while his eye strayed to the House _UNK off . " I am going , " said Mr . _UNK , leaning his arms _UNK on the desk : whereupon , although it was a large double one , there appeared to be not half desk enough for him : " I am going to make an offer of myself in a to your agreeable little friend , Miss _UNK , Mr . _UNK . " " Oh dear me ! " cried Mr . _UNK , rubbing his chin , and looking at his visitor _UNK . " Oh dear me , sir ? " repeated _UNK , drawing back . " Oh dear you , sir ? What may your meaning be , Mr . _UNK ? " " My meaning , " answered a man of business , " is , of course , friendly and _UNK , and that it does you the greatest credit , _UNK short , my meaning is everything you could desire . _UNK , you know , Mr . _UNK " Mr . _UNK paused , and shook his head at him in the _UNK manner , as if he were compelled against his will to add , _UNK , " you know there really is so much too much of you ! " " Well ! " said _UNK , slapping the desk with his _UNK hand , opening his eyes wider , and taking a long breath , " if I understand you , Mr . _UNK , I ' ll be hanged ! " Mr . _UNK adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end , and bit the _UNK of the pen . " D--n it all , sir ! " said _UNK , staring at him , " am I not eligible ? " " Oh dear yes ! Yes . Oh yes , you ' re eligible ! " said Mr . _UNK . " If you say eligible , you are eligible . " " Am I not _UNK ? " asked _UNK . " Oh ! if you come to _UNK , you are _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK . " And advancing ? " " If you come to advancing you know , " said Mr . _UNK , delighted to be able to make another admission , " nobody can doubt that . " " Then what on earth is your meaning , Mr . _UNK ? " demanded _UNK , _UNK _UNK . " Well ! _UNK you going there now ? " asked Mr . _UNK . " _UNK ! " said _UNK , with a _UNK of his fist on the desk . " Then I think I wouldn ' t , if I was you . " " Why ? " said _UNK . " Now , I ' ll put you in a corner , " _UNK shaking the forefinger at him . " You are a man of business and bound to have the reason . INTERVIEW your reason . Why wouldn ' t you go ? " " Because , " said Mr . _UNK , " I wouldn ' t go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed . " " D--n _me_ ! " cried _UNK , " but this beats everything . " Mr . _UNK glanced at the distant House , and glanced at the angry _UNK . " Here ' s the man of _UNK man of _UNK man of _UNK the Bank , " said _UNK ; " and having _UNK up three leading reasons for complete success , he says there ' s no reason at all ! _UNK it with his head on ! " Mr . _UNK remarked upon the _UNK as if it would have been _UNK less remarkable if he had said it with his head off . " When I speak of success , I speak of success with the young lady ; and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable , I speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady . The young lady , my good sir , " said Mr . _UNK , mildly tapping the _UNK arm , " the young lady . The young lady goes before all . " " Then you mean to tell me , Mr . _UNK , " said _UNK , _UNK his elbows , " that it is your _UNK opinion that the young lady at present in question is the _UNK _UNK ? " " Not exactly so . I mean to tell you , Mr . _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , reddening , " that I will hear no _UNK word of that young lady from any lips ; and that if I knew any _UNK I hope I do _UNK taste was so coarse , and whose temper was so _UNK , that he could not and himself from speaking _UNK of that young lady at this desk , not even _UNK ' s should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind . " The necessity of being angry in a smoothed tone had put Mr . _UNK ' s _UNK into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry ; Mr . _UNK ' s veins , _UNK as their courses could usually be , were in no better state now it was his turn . " That is what I mean to tell you , sir , " said Mr . _UNK . " Pray let there be no mistake about it . " Mr . _UNK _UNK the end of the _UNK for a little while , and then stood _UNK the tune out of his teeth with it , which probably gave him a toothache . He broke a awkward silence by saying : " This is something new to me , Mr . _UNK . You deliberately advise me not to go up to _UNK and offer _UNK , _UNK of the King ' s the bar ? " " Do you ask me for my advice , Mr . _UNK ? " " Yes , I do . " " Very good . Then I give it , and you have repeated it correctly . " " And all I can say of it is , " laughed _UNK with the vexed laugh , " that _UNK , ha ! _UNK everything past , present , and to come . " " Now understand me , " pursued Mr . _UNK . " As a man of business , I am not justified in saying anything about this matter , for , as a man of business , I know nothing of it . But , as an old fellow , who has carried Miss _UNK in his arms , who is a trusted friend of Miss _UNK and of her father too , and who has a great affection for them both , I have spoken . A confidence is not of my seeking , recollect . Now , you think I may not be right ? " " Not I ! " said _UNK , whistling . " I can ' t undertake to find third parties in common sense ; I can only find it for myself . I suppose sense in certain quarters ; you suppose _UNK _UNK nonsense . It ' s new to me , but you are right , I dare say . " " What I suppose , Mr . _UNK , I claim to _UNK for _UNK understand me , sir , " said Mr . _UNK , quickly _UNK again , " I will _UNK even at _UNK ' _UNK it _UNK for me by any gentleman wrote . " " There ! I beg your pardon ! " said _UNK . " _UNK . Thank you . Well , Mr . _UNK , I was about to say : _UNK might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken , it might be painful to Doctor _UNK to have the task of being explicit with you , it might be very painful to Miss _UNK to have the task of being explicit with you . You know the terms upon which I have a honour and happiness to stand with the family . If you please , committing you in no way , _UNK you in no way , I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and circumstantially _UNK brought to bear upon it . If you should then be _UNK with it , you can but test its _UNK for yourself ; if , on the other hand , you should be satisfied with it , and it should be what it now is , it may spare all sides what is best spared . What do you say ? " " How long would you keep me in town ? " " Oh ! It is only the question of a few hours . I could go to _UNK in the evening , and come to your the afterwards . " " Then I say yes , " said _UNK : " I won ' t go up there now , I am not so hot upon it as that comes to ; I say yes , and I shall expect you to look in to-night . Good morning . " Then Mr . _UNK turned and burst out of the Bank , causing such a _UNK of air on his passage through , that to stand up against it bowing behind the two , , required the utmost remaining strength of the two causes _UNK . NANCY darkest and feeble persons were always seen by the public in a act of bowing , and were _UNK believed , when they had bowed a customer out , still to keep on bowing in the empty office until they bowed another customer in . A _UNK was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less _UNK ground than moral certainty . _UNK as he was for a large _UNK he had to swallow , he got it down . " And now , " said Mr . _UNK , shaking his _UNK forefinger at the _UNK in general , when it was down , " my way out of this , is , to put you all in the wrong . " It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey _UNK , in which he found great relief . " You shall not put me in the wrong , young lady , " said Mr . _UNK ; " I ' ll do that for you . " whist , when Mr . _UNK called that night as late as ten o ' clock , Mr . _UNK , among the quantity of books and papers _UNK out for the purpose , seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of the morning . He even showed surprise when he saw Mr . _UNK , and was altogether in an absent and _UNK state . " Well ! " said that _UNK _UNK , after a full half-hour of _UNK _UNK to bring him round to the question . " I have been to _UNK . " " To _UNK ? " repeated Mr . _UNK , coldly . " Oh , to be sure ! What am I thinking of ! " " And I have no doubt , " said Mr . _UNK , " that I was right in the conversation we had . My opinion is confirmed , and I _UNK my advice . " " I assure you , " returned Mr . _UNK , in the _UNK way , " that I am sorry for it on your account , and sorry for it on a poor father ' s account . I know this must always be the sore subject with the family ; let us say no more about it . " " I don ' t understand you , " said Mr . _UNK . " I dare say not , " rejoined _UNK , nodding his head in a smoothing and final way ; " no matter , no matter . " " But it does matter , " Mr . _UNK urged . " No it doesn ' t ; I assure you it doesn ' t . Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense , and a laudable _UNK where there is not a laudable _UNK , I am well out of my mistake , and no harm is done . Young women have committed similar _UNK often before , and have _UNK them in poverty and obscurity often before . In an _UNK aspect , I am sorry that a thing is dropped , because it would have been a bad thing for me in the swelling point of view ; in a selfish aspect , I am glad that a thing has dropped , because it would have been a bad thing for me in the within point of _UNK is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it . There is no harm at all done . I have not possession to the young lady , and , between ourselves , I am by no means certain , on reflection , that I ever should have committed myself to that extent . Mr . _UNK , you cannot thrill the _UNK _UNK and _UNK of _UNK girls ; you must not expect to do it , or you will always be disappointed . Now , pray say no more about it . I tell you , I regret it on account of others , but I am satisfied on my own account . And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you , and for giving me your advice ; you know the young lady better than I do ; you were right , it never would have done . " Mr . _UNK was so taken _UNK , that he looked quite confronted at Mr . _UNK _UNK him towards the door , with an appearance of _UNK generosity , to , and _UNK , on his deeply-set head . " Make the best of it , my dear sir , " said _UNK ; " say no more about it ; thank you again for allowing me to sound you ; good night ! " Mr . _UNK was out in the night , before he knew where he was . Mr . _UNK was lying back on his sofa , winking at his ceiling . _UNK . The _UNK of No _UNK If _UNK _UNK ever shone anywhere , he certainly never shone in the house of Doctor _UNK . He had been there often , during the whole year , and had always been the same _UNK and _UNK _UNK there . When he _UNK to talk , he talked well ; but , a cloud of caring for nothing , which _UNK him with such the maids darkness , was very _UNK _UNK by the light within him . And yet he did care something for the streets that _UNK that house , and for the _UNK ' that made their pavements . Many the night he _UNK and _UNK wandered there , when wine had brought no _UNK gladness to him ; many a dreary daybreak _UNK his solitary figure lingering there , and still lingering there when the first beams of the sun brought into strong relief , removed beauties of _UNK in and of a and lofty ' , as perhaps the quiet time brought some sense of better things , else forgotten and _UNK , into his mind . Of late , a neglected bed in the _UNK _UNK had known him more _UNK than ever ; and often when he had thrown himself upon it no longer than a few minutes , he had got up again , and haunted that neighbourhood . On the day in _UNK , when Mr . _UNK ( after _UNK to his _UNK that " he had thought better of that the matter " ) had carried his _UNK into _UNK , and when the sight and scent of flowers in the City streets had some _UNK of goodness in them for the worst , of health for the _UNK , and of youth for the oldest , _UNK ' s feet still trod those ' . From being irresolute and _UNK , his feet became ' by an intention , and , in a working out of that intention , they took him to a Doctor ' s door . He was shown _UNK , and found _UNK at her work , alone . She had never been quite at her ease with him , and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table . But , looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few _UNK , she observed the change in it . " I fear you are not well , Mr . _UNK ! " " No . But the life I lead , Miss _UNK , is not conducive to health . What is to be expected of , or by , such _UNK ? " " Is it _UNK me ; I have begun the question on my _UNK pity to live no better life ? " " God knows it is a shame ! " " Then why not change it ? " Looking gently at him again , she was surprised and _UNK to see that there were tears in his eyes . There were tears in his voice too , as he answered : " It is too late for that . I shall never be better than I am . I shall sink lower , and be worse . " He leaned an elbow on her table , and covered his eyes with his hand . The table trembled in the silence that followed . She had never seen him softened , and was much distressed . He knew her to be so , without looking at her , and said : " Pray forgive me , Miss _UNK . I break down before the knowledge of what I want to say to you . Will you hear me ? " " If it will do you any good , Mr . _UNK , if it would make you happier , it would make me very glad ! " " God bless you for your sweet compassion ! " He _UNK his face after a little while , and spoke steadily . " Don ' t be afraid to hear me . Don ' t shrink from anything I say . I am like one who died young . All my life might have been . " " No , Mr . _UNK . I am sure that the best part of it might still be ; I am sure that you might be much , much worthier of yourself . " " Say of you , Miss _UNK , and although I know _UNK in the mystery of my own wretched heart I know _UNK shall never forget it ! " She was pale and trembling . He came to her relief with the fixed despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have been _UNK . " If it had been possible , Miss _UNK , that you could have returned the love of the man you see before _UNK away , wasted , drunken , poor creature of _UNK as you know him to _UNK would have been conscious this day and hour , in spite of his happiness , that he would bring you to misery , bring you to sorrow and repentance , blight you , disgrace you , pull you down with him . I know very well that you can have no tenderness for me ; I ask for none ; I am even thankful that it cannot be . " " Without it , can I not save you , Mr . _UNK ? patted I not recall _UNK me again ! --to the better course ? patted I in no way _UNK your confidence ? I know this is the confidence , " she modestly said , after a little hesitation , and in earnest tears , " I know you would say this to no one else . teaspoon I turn it to no good account for yourself , Mr . _UNK ? " He shook his head . " To none . No , Miss _UNK , to none . If you will hear me through a very little more , all you can ever do for me is done . I wish you to know that you have been the last dream of my soul . In my degradation I have not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father , and of this home made such a home by you , has stirred old shadows that I thought had died out of me . _UNK I knew you , I have been troubled by the remorse that I thought would never ' me again , and have heard whispers from old voices _UNK me upward , that I thought were silent for ever . I have had _UNK ideas of striving afresh , beginning ' , shaking off _UNK and _UNK , and _UNK out a abandoned _UNK . A dream , all a dream , that ends in nothing , and leaves the sleeper where he lay down , but I wish you to know that you _UNK it . " " Will nothing of it remain ? _UNK Mr . _UNK , think again ! savagely again ! " " No , Miss _UNK ; all through it , I have known myself to be quite _UNK . And yet I have had a weakness , and have still a weakness , to wish you to know with what a sudden _UNK you Ain me , heap of ashes that I am , into _UNK fire , however , inseparable in its nature from myself , quickening nothing , lighting nothing , doing no service , idly burning away . " " _UNK it is my misfortune , Mr . _UNK , to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew _UNK " " Don ' t say that , Miss _UNK , for you would have that me , if anything could . You will not be the cause of my becoming worse . " " _UNK a state of your mind that you describe , is , at all events , _UNK to some influence of _UNK is what I mean , if I can make it _UNK I use no influence to serve you ? Have I no power for good , with you , at all ? " " The utmost good that I am capable of now , Miss _UNK , I have come here to _UNK . Let me carry through the rest of my _UNK life , the remembrance that I opened my heart to you , last of all the world ; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could _UNK and pity . " " Which I entreated you to believe , again and again , most _UNK , with all my heart , was capable of better things , Mr . _UNK ! " " _UNK me to believe it no more , Miss _UNK . I have proved myself , and I know better . I distress you ; I draw fast to an end . Will you let me believe , when I recall this day , that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast , and that it lies there alone , and will be brown-cloth by no one ? " " If that will be the consolation to you , yes . " " Not even by a dearest one ever to be known to you ? " " Mr . _UNK , " she answered , after an agitated pause , " a secret is yours , not mine ; and I promise to respect it . " " Thank you . And again , God bless you . " He put her hand to his lips , and moved towards the door . " Be under no apprehension , Miss _UNK , of my ever resuming this conversation by so much as the passing word . I will never _UNK to it again . If I were dead , that could not be _UNK than it is corroboration . In the hour of my death , I shall hold beneath the one good _UNK shall thank and bless you for _UNK my last avowal of myself was made to you , and that my name , and faults , and besought were gently carried in your heart . suspiciously it otherwise be light and happy ! " He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be , and it was so sad to think how much he had thrown away , and how much he every day kept down and _UNK , that _UNK _UNK wept mournfully for him as he stood looking back at her . " Be _UNK ! " he said , " I am not worth such feeling , Miss _UNK . An hour or two candles , and the low companions and low habits that I scorn but yield to , will render me less worth such tears as those , than any wretch who _UNK along the streets . Be _UNK ! But , within myself , I shall always be , towards you , what I am now , though _UNK I shall be what you have heretofore seen me . The last supplication but one I make to you , is , that you will believe this of me . " " I will , Mr . _UNK . " " My last supplication of all , is this ; and with it , I will relieve you of the visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in _UNK , and between whom and you there is an _UNK space . It is useless to say it , I know , but it _UNK out of my soul . For you , and for any dear to you , I would do anything . If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it , I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you . inability to hold me in your mind , at some quiet times , as ardent and _UNK in this one thing . The time will come , the time will not be long in coming , when new _UNK will be formed about _UNK that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to a home you so _UNK dearest _UNK that will ever grace and gladden you . _UNK Miss _UNK , when the little picture of a happy father ' s face looks up in yours , when you see your own bright beauty springing up ' at your feet , think now and then that there is the man who would give his life , to keep the life you love beside you ! " He said , " Farewell ! " said the last " God bless you ! " and left her . _UNK . A _UNK _UNK To the eyes of Mr . _UNK _UNK , sitting on his stool in _UNK with his _UNK _UNK beside him , a vast number and variety of objects in , were every day presented . Who could sit upon anything in _UNK during the busy hours of the day , and not be _UNK and exchanging by two unwillingly processions , one ever _UNK _UNK with the sun , the other ever _UNK _UNK from the sun , both ever _UNK to the _UNK beyond the range of red and _UNK where the sun goes down ! With his straw in his mouth , Mr . _UNK sat watching the two _UNK , like the _UNK the who has for several _UNK been on duty watching one _UNK that _UNK had no expectation of their ever running dry . Nor would it have been an expectation of a , kind , since a small part of his _UNK was derived from the _UNK of timid women ( _UNK of a full habit and past the middle term of life ) from _UNK ' s side of the _UNK to the opposite confusion . _UNK as such companionship was in every separate instance , Mr . _UNK never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health . And it was from a _UNK bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose , that he _UNK his finances , as just now observed . _UNK was , when a _UNK sat upon a stool in a public place , and _UNK in the sight of men . Mr . _UNK , sitting on a stool in the public place , but not being a _UNK , _UNK as little as possible , and looked about him . It fell out that he was thus engaged in the season when crowds were few , and _UNK women few , and when his affairs in general were so _UNK as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs . _UNK must have been " _UNK " in some pointed manner , when an unusual concourse pouring down _UNK _UNK , attracted his attention . mere that way , Mr . _UNK made out that some kind of funeral was coming along , and that there was _UNK objection to this funeral , which engendered _UNK . " Young _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , turning to his _UNK , " it ' s a _UNK ' . " " _UNK , father ! " cried Young _UNK . A young gentleman uttered this _UNK sound with mysterious _UNK . The elder gentleman took a cry so ill , that he watched his opportunity , and _UNK a young gentleman on the ear . " What d ' ye mean ? What are you _UNK at ? What do you want to _UNK to your own father , you young _UNK ? This boy is a getting too many for _me_ ! " said Mr . _UNK , surveying him . " a and his _UNK ! Don ' t let me hear no more of you , or you shall feel some more of me . D ' ye hear ? " " I warn ' t doing no harm , " Young _UNK protested , rubbing his cheek . " _UNK it then , " said Mr . _UNK ; " I won ' t have none of _UNK no _UNK . Get the top of that there seat , and look at the crowd . " His son obeyed , and a crowd approached ; they were _UNK and a round a _UNK and and _UNK defending coach , in which attracting coach there was only one ' , dressed in the _UNK _UNK that were considered essential to the dignity of the position . The position appeared by no means to please him , however , with an increasing _UNK surrounding the coach , _UNK him , making individual at him , and , _UNK and calling out : " _UNK ! INTERVIEW ! _UNK ! _UNK ! sitiwation ! " with many compliments too numerous and _UNK to repeat . _UNK had at all times a remarkable _UNK for Mr . _UNK ; he always _UNK up his senses , and became excited , when a funeral passed _UNK ' s . _UNK , therefore , the funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly , and he asked of the first man who ran against him : " What is it , brother ? What ' s it about ? " " _I_ don ' t know , " said the man . " ' ! _UNK ! _UNK ! sitiwation ! " He asked another man . " Who is it ? " " _I_ don ' t know , " returned the man , clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless , and _UNK in the same heat and with the greatest , , " Off ! _UNK ! _UNK , _UNK ! _UNK ! " At length , the person better informed on the merits of the case , tumbled against him , and from this person he blooming that the funeral was the funeral of one _UNK _UNK . " Was He the spy ? " asked Mr . _UNK . " Old Bailey However , " returned his informant . " _UNK ! _UNK ! _UNK ! Old earning _UNK ! " " Why , to be sure ! " exclaimed _UNK , recalling a _UNK at which he had assisted . " I ' ve seen him . magnificent , is he ? " " Dead as _UNK , " returned the other , " and can ' t be too dead . Have ' em out , there ! INTERVIEW ! Pull ' em out , there ! sitiwation ! " The idea was so _UNK in a ' absence of any idea , that the crowd caught it up with eagerness , and loudly repeating the suggestion to have ' em out , and to pull ' em out , _UNK the two _UNK so closely that they came to the stop . On the crowd ' s opening a coach doors , the one the _UNK out of himself and was in their hands for a moment ; but he was so courts , and made such good use of his time , that in another moment he was _UNK away up the _UNK , after shedding his cloak , hat , long hatband , white pocket-handkerchief , and other _UNK tears . These , the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great _UNK , while a _UNK hurriedly shut up their shops ; for the crowd in those times stopped at nothing , and was a a much dreaded . They had already got the length of opening a hearse to take a coffin out , when some brighter genius the instead , its being escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing . _UNK _UNK being much _UNK , this suggestion , too , was received with _UNK , and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out , while as many people got on the roof of a hearse as could by any exercise of ingenuity stick upon it . inspect the first of these _UNK was _UNK _UNK himself , who modestly concealed his _UNK head from a observation of _UNK ' s , in a further corner of the wearer coach . A officiating _UNK made some _UNK against these changes in the ceremonies ; but , the river being _UNK near , and several voices remarking on the efficacy of cold _UNK in bringing _UNK members of the profession to reason , the _UNK was faint and brief . The _UNK _UNK started , with the chimney-sweep driving the _UNK by a regular driver , who was _UNK beside him , under close inspection , for the _UNK with the _UNK , also attended by his _UNK _UNK , driving the wearer coach . A _UNK , the _UNK street character of the time , was impressed as an additional D--me , before the _UNK had gone far down the Strand ; and his bear , who was black and very _UNK , gave quite an _UNK air to that part of the _UNK in which he walked . Thus , with _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , and _UNK _UNK of the , the _UNK _UNK went its way , recruiting at every step , and all the shops shutting up before it . sobs destination was the old church of Saint _UNK , far off in the fields . It got there in course of time ; insisted on pouring into the _UNK ; finally , accomplished a interment of the _UNK _UNK _UNK in its own way , and highly to its own satisfaction . The dead man disposed of , and a crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself , another brighter genius ( or perhaps the same ) conceived the humour of _UNK _UNK _UNK , as Old Bailey _UNK , and _UNK hobbling on them . _UNK was given to some scores of _UNK persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives , in the _UNK of this fancy , and they were roughly _UNK and maltreated . A _UNK to the sport of _UNK , and thence to the plundering of public-houses , was easy and natural . At last , after several hours , when sundry _UNK had been pulled down , and some _UNK had been torn up , to arm the more _UNK spirits , the rumour got about that a _UNK were coming . Before this rumour , the crowd gradually _UNK away , and perhaps the _UNK came , and perhaps they never came , and this was the usual progress of the mob . Mr . _UNK did not assist at the closing sports , but had remained behind in the churchyard , to _UNK and _UNK with the _UNK . The place had a soothing influence on him . He needless the pipe from a neighbouring public-house , and smoked it , looking in at a bellowing and _UNK considering the spot . " _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , _UNK himself in his usual way , " you see that there _UNK that day , and you see with your own eyes that he was a young ' un and the straight made ' un . " Having smoked his pipe out , and _UNK a little longer , he turned himself about , that he might appear , before the hour of closing , on his station at _UNK ' s . Whether his meditations on mortality had touched his _UNK , or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss , or whether he desired to show the little attention to an _UNK man , is not so much to the purpose , as that he made a short call upon his medical _UNK distinguished _UNK his way back . Young _UNK relieved his father with dutiful interest , and reported No job in his absence . A bank closed , the darkened _UNK came out , the usual watch was set , and Mr . _UNK and his son went home to tea . " Now , I tell you where it is ! " said Mr . _UNK to his wife , on entering . " If , as the honest tradesman , my _UNK goes wrong to-night , I shall make sure that you ' ve been _UNK again me , and I shall work you for it just the same as if I seen you do it . " The the Mrs . _UNK shook her head . " Why , you ' re at it afore my face ! " said Mr . _UNK , with signs of angry apprehension . " I am saying nothing . " " Well , then ; don ' t _UNK nothing . You might as well _UNK as _UNK . You may as well go again me one way as another . _UNK it altogether . " " Yes , _UNK . " " Yes , _UNK , " repeated Mr . _UNK sitting down to tea . " Ah ! It _is_ yes , _UNK . That ' s about it . You may say yes , _UNK . " Mr . _UNK had no particular meaning in these sulky _UNK , but made use of them , as people not _UNK do , to express general ironical _UNK . " You and your yes , _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , taking the _UNK out of his _UNK , and seeming to help it down with a large _UNK oyster out of his him . " Ah ! I think so . I believe you . " " You are going out to-night ? " asked his decent wife , when he took another _UNK . " Yes , I am . " " May I go with you , father ? " asked his son , briskly . " No , you mayn ' t . I ' m a _UNK your mother _UNK philosophically . That ' s where I ' m going to . mere the background . " " Your _UNK gets _UNK rusty ; don ' t it , father ? " " Never you mind . " " Shall you bring any _UNK home , father ? " " If I don ' t , you ' ll have short commons , to-morrow , " returned that gentleman , shaking his head ; " that ' s questions enough for you ; I ain ' t a going out , till you ' ve been long _UNK . " He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping the most _UNK watch on Mrs . _UNK , and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any _UNK to his disadvantage . With this view , he urged his son to hold her in conversation also , and led a sleeves woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her , rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections . The _UNK person could have rendered no greater _UNK to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this and of his wife . It was as if the _UNK _UNK in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story . " And mind you ! " said Mr . _UNK . " No _UNK to-morrow ! If I , as the honest tradesman , succeed in providing the _UNK of meat or two , none of your not touching of it , and sticking to bread . If I , as the honest tradesman , am able to provide a little beer , none of your declaring on water . When you go to seed , do as , does . bred will be a ugly customer to you , if you don ' t . _I_ ' m your However , you know . " Then he began seizing again : " With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink ! I don ' t know how scarce you mayn ' t make the . and drink here , by your _UNK tricks and your _UNK conduct . Look at your boy : he _is_ your ' the , ain ' t he ? He ' s as thin as the _UNK . Do you call yourself a mother , and not know that a mother ' s first duty is to blow her boy out ? " This touched Young _UNK on the tender place ; who _UNK his mother to perform her first duty , and , whatever else she did or neglected , above all things to lay _UNK stress on the discharge of that _UNK _UNK so _UNK and _UNK indicated by his other . . Thus the evening wore away with the _UNK family , until Young _UNK was ordered to bed , and his mother , laid under similar injunctions , obeyed them . Mr . _UNK _UNK the earlier watches of the night with solitary pipes , and did not start upon his _UNK until nearly one o ' clock . Towards that small and _UNK hour , he rose up from his chair , took the key out of his pocket , opened the locked cupboard , and brought forth a sack , a crowbar of convenient size , a rope and chain , and other bluff-looking _UNK of that nature . _UNK these articles about him in skilful manner , he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs . _UNK , extinguished the light , and went out . Young _UNK , who had only made a feint of _UNK when he went to bed , was not long after his father . Under cover of the darkness he followed out of the room , followed down the stairs , followed down the court , followed out into the streets . He was in no _UNK concerning his getting into the house again , for it was full of _UNK , and the door stood _UNK all night . _UNK by a laudable _UNK to study the art and mystery of his father ' s honest calling , Young _UNK , keeping as close to house _UNK , walls , and doorways , as his eyes were close to one another , held his honoured haggardness in view . The honoured , _UNK _UNK , had not gone far , when he was joined by another _UNK of _UNK _UNK , and the two trudged on together . assuming half an hour from the first starting , they were beyond a winking lamps , and the more than winking _UNK , and were out upon the lonely road . Another _UNK was picked up _UNK that so _UNK , that if Young _UNK had been _UNK , he might have supposed a second _UNK of a gentle craft to have , all of a sudden , split himself into two . The three went on , and Young _UNK went on , until the three stopped under a bank _UNK a road . Upon the top of a bank was a low brick wall , _UNK by an iron knuckles . In the shadow of bank and wall the three turned out of the road , and up the blind lane , of which the _UNK , risen to some eight or ten feet _UNK one side . _UNK down in a corner , peeping up the lane , the next object that Young _UNK saw , was the form of his honoured house-tops , pretty well defined against the _UNK and _UNK moon , nimbly _UNK an iron gate . He was soon over , and then a second _UNK got over , and then the third . They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate , and lay there the _UNK perhaps . Then , they moved away on their hands and knees . It was now Young _UNK ' s turn to approach the gate : which he did , holding his breath . _UNK down again in a corner there , and looking in , he made out a three _UNK creeping through some rank grass ! and all the gravestones in the _UNK was a large churchyard that they were _UNK on like ghosts in white , while the church a itself looked on like the ghost of the monstrous _UNK . They did not creep far , before they stopped and stood upright . And then they began to _UNK . They _UNK with a spade , at first . _UNK a honoured a appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great concern . Whatever RELATES they worked with , they worked hard , until the awful striking of the church clock so terrified Young _UNK , that he made off , with his hair as stiff as his father ' s . But , his _UNK desire to know more about these matters , not only stopped him in his running away , but _UNK him back again . They were still illegal _UNK , when he peeped in at the gate for a second time ; but , now they seemed to have got the _UNK . There was a screwing and complaining sound down below , and their bent figures were the , as if by the weight . By slow degrees the weight broke away the earth upon it , and came to the surface . Young _UNK very well knew what it would be ; but , when he saw it , and saw his honoured successive about to wrench it open , he was so frightened , being new to the sight , that he made off again , and never stopped until he had run a mile or more . He would not have stopped then , for anything less necessary than breath , it being a _UNK sort of race that he ran , and one highly desirable to get to the end of . He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen was running after him ; and , _UNK as _UNK on behind him , bolt upright , upon its narrow end , always on the point of _UNK him and _UNK on at his _UNK taking his _UNK was a _UNK to _UNK . It was an _UNK and _UNK _UNK too , for , while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful , he darted out into the _UNK to avoid dark alleys , fearful of its coming _UNK out of them like the _UNK boy ' s _UNK without tail and _UNK . It hid in doorways too , rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors , and drawing them up to its ears , as if it were laughing . It got into shadows on the road , and lay _UNK on its back to _UNK him up . All this time it was modest _UNK on behind and gaining on him , so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead . And even then it would not leave him , but followed him upstairs with the _UNK on every _UNK , _UNK into bed with him , and _UNK down , dead and heavy , on his breast when he fell asleep . From his a courts , Young _UNK in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before _UNK , by the presence of his father in the family room . Something had gone wrong with him ; at least , so Young _UNK _UNK , from the circumstance of his holding Mrs . _UNK by the ears , and knocking the back of her head against the _UNK of the bed . " I told you I would , " said Mr . _UNK , " and I did . " " _UNK , _UNK , _UNK ! " his wife Angels . " You oppose yourself to the profit of the business , " said _UNK , " and me and my partners suffer . You was to honour and obey ; why the devil don ' t you ? " " I try to be a good wife , _UNK , " the poor woman protested , with tears . " Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband ' s business ? Is it _UNK your husband to insert his business ? Is it _UNK your husband to _UNK him on the _UNK subject of his business ? " " You hadn ' t taken to a dreadful business then , _UNK . " " It ' s enough for you , " retorted Mr . _UNK , " to be the wife of the honest tradesman , and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didn ' t . The _UNK and _UNK wife would let his trade alone altogether . Call yourself the religious woman ? If you ' re the religious woman , give me a _UNK one ! You have no more _UNK ' ral sense of duty than the bed of this here the river has of the chaise-window , and _UNK it must be knocked into you . " The _UNK was conducted in a low tone of voice , and terminated in the honest tradesman ' s kicking off his _UNK boots , and lying down at his length on the floor . After taking a timid peep at him lying on his back , with his rusty hands under his head for the pillow , his son lay down too , and fell asleep again . There was no _UNK for breakfast , and not much of anything else . Mr . _UNK was out of spirits , and out of temper , and kept an iron _UNK by him as the _UNK for the summit of Mrs . _UNK , in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying _UNK . He was he and washed at the usual hour , and set off with his son to pursue his _UNK calling . Young _UNK , walking with a stool under his arm at his father ' s side along sunny and crowded _UNK , was a very different Young _UNK from him of the previous night , running home through darkness and solitude from his grim _UNK . His cunning was fresh with a day , and his _UNK were gone with a _UNK which particulars it is not improbable that he had _UNK in _UNK and the City of London , that fine morning . " _UNK , " said Young _UNK , as they walked along : taking care to keep at arm ' s length and to have a stool well between them : " what ' s the _UNK ? " Mr . _UNK came to the stop on the pavement before he answered , " How should I know ? " " I thought you _UNK everything , father , " said the artless boy . " Hem ! Well , " returned Mr . _UNK , going on again , and lifting off his hat to give his recumbant free play , " he ' s the tradesman . " " What ' s his goods , father ? " asked a brisk Young _UNK . " His goods , " said Mr . _UNK , after turning it over in his mind , " is the region of _UNK goods . " " _UNK ' bodies , ain ' t it , father ? " asked a lively boy . " I believe it is something of that sort , " said Mr . _UNK . " Oh , father , I should so like to be the _UNK when I ' m quite _UNK up ! " Mr . _UNK was soothed , but shook his head in the _UNK and moral way . " It _UNK upon how you _UNK your talents . Be careful to _UNK your talents , and never to say no more than you can help to nobody , and there ' s no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for . " As Young _UNK , thus encouraged , went on a few yards in advance , to plant a stool in the shadow of the Bar , Mr . _UNK added to himself : " _UNK , you honest tradesman , there ' s hopes wot that boy will yet be the blessing to you , and a recompense to you for his mother ! " _UNK . _UNK There had been earlier drinking than usual in the _UNK of _UNK _UNK . As early as six o ' clock in the morning , sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within , bending over _UNK of wine . _UNK _UNK sold the very thin wine at the best of times , but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time . A _UNK wine , moreover , or the _UNK , for its influence on a mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy . No hovels _UNK flame leaped out of a pressed _UNK of _UNK _UNK : but , the _UNK fire that burnt in the dark , lay hidden in the _UNK of it . This had been the third morning in courts , on which there had been early drinking at the _UNK of _UNK _UNK . It had begun on Monday , and here was _UNK come . There had been more of early brooding than drinking ; for , many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of a opening of the door , who could not have laid the piece of money on the counter to save their souls . These were to a full as interested in the place , however , as if they could have commanded whole _UNK of wine ; and they glided from seat to seat , and from corner to corner , swallowing talk in lieu of drink , with greedy looks . holds an unusual flow of company , the master of the _UNK was not visible . He was not missed ; for , nobody who crossed the _UNK looked for him , nobody asked for him , nobody wondered to see only _UNK _UNK in her seat , presiding over the _UNK of wine , with a bowl of _UNK small coins before her , as much defaced and beaten out of their original _UNK as a small _UNK of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come . A suspended interest and a ' absence of mind , were perhaps observed by the _UNK who looked in at the _UNK , as they looked in at every place , high and low , from the king ' s , to a criminal ' s _UNK . _UNK at cards _UNK , _UNK at _UNK _UNK built _UNK with them , _UNK drew figures on the _UNK with _UNK drops of wine , _UNK _UNK herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick , and saw and heard something inaudible and _UNK a long way off . Thus , Saint _UNK in this _UNK feature of his , until _UNK . It was high _UNK , when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps : of whom , one was _UNK _UNK : the other the _UNK of roads in a blue cap . All _UNK and _UNK , the two entered the _UNK . Their arrival had lighted the kind of fire in the breast of Saint _UNK , fast spreading as they came along , which stirred and _UNK in the of faces at most doors and windows . _UNK , no one had followed them , and no man spoke when they entered the _UNK , though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them . " Good day , gentlemen ! " said _UNK _UNK . It may have been a signal for _UNK a general tongue . It ' an answering chorus of " Good day ! " " It is bad weather , gentlemen , " said _UNK , shaking his head . Upon which , every man looked at his neighbour , and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent . sobs one man , who got up and went out . " My wife , " said _UNK aloud , addressing _UNK _UNK : " I have from certain _UNK with this good _UNK of roads , called _UNK . I met him--by _UNK day and half ' s journey out of wheels . He is a good child , this _UNK of roads , called _UNK . Give him to drink , my wife ! " The second man got up and went out . _UNK _UNK set wine before the _UNK of roads called _UNK , who _UNK his blue cap to the company , and drank . In a breast of his _UNK he carried some coarse dark bread ; he ate of this between _UNK , and sat _UNK and drinking near _UNK _UNK ' s counter . The third man got up and went out . _UNK refreshed himself with a draught of _UNK , he took less than was given to the stranger , as being himself a man to whom it was no _UNK stood waiting until a countryman had made his breakfast . He looked at no one present , and no one now looked at him ; not even _UNK _UNK , who had taken up her ! , and was at work . " Have you finished your _UNK , friend ? " he asked , in due season . " Yes , thank you . " " Come , then ! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy . It will suit you to a marvel . " wholesome of the _UNK into the street , out of the street into the _UNK , out of the _UNK up a steep staircase , out of the staircase into the _UNK a _UNK where a way--which man sat on a low bench , stooping forward and very busy , making shoes . No coffee man was there now ; but , the three men were there who had gone out of the _UNK _UNK . And between them and a way--which man _UNK off , was the one small _UNK , that they had once looked in at him through the Philosopher in the wall . _UNK closed the door carefully , and spoke in a subdued voice : " _UNK One , _UNK Two , _UNK Three ! This is a witness encountered by appointment , by me , _UNK _UNK . He will tell you all . Speak , _UNK _UNK ! " The _UNK of roads , blue cap in hand , wiped his _UNK forehead with it , and said , " Where shall I _UNK , _UNK ? " " _UNK , " was _UNK _UNK ' s not unreasonable reply , " at the commencement . " " I saw him then , _UNK , " began the _UNK of gesticulation , " the year ago this running summer , _UNK the carriage of the _UNK , hanging by the chain . _UNK the manner of it . I leaving my work on the road , the sun going to bed , the carriage of the _UNK slowly _UNK the hill , he hanging by the _UNK this . " Again the _UNK of roads went through the whole performance ; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time , seeing that it had been the ' resource and _UNK entertainment of his village during the whole year . _UNK One struck in , and asked if he had ever seen a man before ? " Never , " answered the _UNK of roads , recovering his _UNK . _UNK Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then ? " By his tall figure , " said the _UNK of roads , softly , and with his finger at his nose . " When _UNK the _UNK you that evening , ' Say , what is he like ? ' I make _UNK , ' _UNK as the _UNK . ' " " You should have said , short as the dwarf , " returned _UNK Two . " But what did I know ? The deed was not then accomplished , neither did he _UNK in me . _UNK ! accommodate those circumstances even , I do not offer my testimony . _UNK a _UNK _UNK me with his finger , standing near our little _UNK , and says , ' To me ! squeezed-up that rascal ! ' My _UNK , _UNK , I offer nothing . " " He is right there , _UNK , " murmured _UNK , to him who had interrupted . " Go on ! " " Good ! " said the _UNK of roads , with an air of mystery . " The tall man is lost , and he is _UNK many months ? _UNK , ten , eleven ? " " No matter , a number , " said _UNK . " He is well hidden , but at last he is _UNK found . Go on ! " " I am again at work upon the _UNK , and the sun is again about to go to bed . I am collecting my tools to revert to my cottage down in the village below , where it is already dark , when I raise my eyes , and see coming over the hill six _UNK . In the midst of them is a tall man with his arms _UNK to his _UNK this ! " With the aid of his _UNK cap , he represented the man with his elbows bound fast at his _UNK , with _UNK that were knotted behind him . " I stand aside , _UNK , by my heap of ' , to see the _UNK and their prisoner pass ( for it is a solitary road , that , where any spectacle is well worth looking at ) , and at first , as they approach , I see no more than that they are six _UNK with a tall man bound , and that they are almost black to my _UNK on the side of the sun going to bed , where they have a red edge , _UNK . _UNK , I see that their long shadows are on the hollow _UNK on the opposite side of the road , and are on the hill above it , and are like a shadows of _UNK . _UNK , I see that they are covered with dust , and that the dust the with them as they come , d--me , ' ! But when they advance quite near to me , I recognise a tall man , and he _UNK me . Ah , but he would be well content to _UNK himself over the _UNK once again , as on the evening when he and I first encountered , close to the same spot ! " He described it as if he were there , and it was evident that he saw it _UNK ; perhaps he had not seen much in his life . " I do not show the _UNK that I recognise a tall man ; he does not show the _UNK that he _UNK me ; we do it , and we know it , with our eyes . ' Come on ! ' says the chief of that company , pointing to the village , ' bring him fast to his of ! ' and they bring him faster . I follow . His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight , his wooden shoes are large and _UNK , and he is lame . Because he is lame , and consequently slow , they drive him with their _UNK this ! " He _UNK the action of a man ' s being impelled forward by the _UNK of _UNK . " As they interchanging the hill like madmen running the race , he . . They laugh and pick him up again . His face is bleeding and covered with dust , but he cannot touch it ; thereupon they laugh again . They bring him into the village ; all the village _UNK to look ; they take him past a mill , and up to a prison ; all the village sees the prison gate open in the darkness of the night , and swallow _UNK this ! " He opened his mouth as wide as he could , and shut it with the filthiest snap of his teeth . _UNK of his _UNK to mar the effect by opening it again , _UNK said , " Go on , _UNK . " " All the village , " pursued the _UNK of roads , on tiptoe and in a low voice , " _UNK ; all the village whispers by the _UNK ; all the village _UNK ; all the village _UNK of that unhappy one , within a locks and bars of a prison on the _UNK , and never to come out of it , except to _UNK . In the morning , with my tools upon my shoulder , eating my morsel of black bread as I go , I make a circuit by a prison , on my way to my work . There I see him , high up , behind the bars of a lofty iron cage , _UNK and dusty as last night , looking through . He has no hand free , to wave to me ; I dare not call to him ; he , me like a dead man . " _UNK and the three glanced darkly at one another . The looks of all of them were dark , empty-handed , and _UNK , as they listened to a countryman ' s story ; the manner of all of them , while it was secret , was _UNK too . They had the air of a rough _UNK ; _UNK One and Two sitting on the old _UNK , each with his chin resting on his hand , and his eyes intent on the _UNK ; _UNK Three , equally intent , on one knee behind them , with his agitated hand always gliding over the _UNK of fine nerves about his mouth and nose ; _UNK standing between them and the _UNK , whom he had stationed in the light of the window , by turns looking from him to them , and from them to him . " Go on , _UNK , " said _UNK . " He remains up there in his iron cage some days . The village looks at him by _UNK , for it is afraid . But it always looks up , from the distance , at a prison on the _UNK ; and in the evening , when the work of the day is achieved and it _UNK to _UNK at the _UNK , all faces are turned towards the prison . _UNK , they were turned towards the _UNK ; now , they are turned towards the prison . They whisper at the _UNK , that although incidental to death he will not be executed ; they say that _UNK have been presented in , , showing that he was _UNK and made mad by the death of his child ; they say that a _UNK has been presented to the King himself . What do I know ? It is possible . Perhaps yes , perhaps no . " " Listen then , _UNK , " in One of that name sternly interposed . " the that the _UNK was presented to the King and _UNK . All here , yourself _UNK , saw the King take it , in his carriage in the street , sitting beside the _UNK . It is _UNK whom you see here , who , at the hazard of his life , darted out before the horses , with the _UNK in his hand . " " And once again listen , _UNK ! " said the kneeling in Three : his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves , with a _UNK greedy air , as if he _UNK for _UNK was neither food nor drink ; " a guard , horse and foot , surrounded a _UNK , and struck him blows . You hear ? " " I hear , _UNK . " " Go on then , " said _UNK . " Again ; on the other hand , they whisper at the _UNK , " resumed a countryman , " that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot , and that he will very certainly be stormy . They even whisper that because he has _UNK _UNK , and because _UNK was the father of his _UNK you _UNK will be executed as the _UNK . One old man says at the _UNK , that his right hand , _UNK with a knife , will be burnt off before his face ; that , into repeating which will be made in his arms , his breast , and his legs , there will be poured boiling _UNK , _UNK lead , hot _UNK , _UNK , and _UNK ; finally , that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses . That old man says , all this was actually done to the prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King , _UNK _UNK . But how do I know if he lies ? I am not the _UNK . " " Listen once again then , _UNK ! " said the man with a restless hand and the _UNK air . " The name of that prisoner was _UNK , and it was all done in open day , in the open streets of this city of the ; and nothing was more noticed in a vast concourse that saw it done , than the crowd of ladies of profligacy and fashion , who were full of eager attention to the _UNK the last , _UNK , prolonged until nightfall , when he had lost two legs and an arm , and still breathed ! And it was _UNK , how old are you ? " " _UNK , " said the _UNK of roads , who looked _UNK . " It was done when you were more than ten years old ; you might have seen it . " " _UNK ! " said _UNK , with grim impatience . " Long live the Devil ! Go on . " " Well ! Some whisper this , some whisper that ; they speak of nothing else ; even the _UNK appears to fall to that tune . At length , on Sunday night when all the village is asleep , come _UNK , winding down from a prison , and their _UNK ring on the ' of the little street . _UNK _UNK , so hammer , _UNK laugh and sing ; in the morning , by the _UNK , there is raised the gallows forty feet high , _UNK the water . " The _UNK of roads looked _UNK rather than _UNK a low ceiling , and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky . " All work is stopped , all _UNK there , nobody matters--especially the _UNK out , the _UNK are there with the rest . At _UNK , a roll of _UNK . _UNK have marched into a prison in the night , and he is in the midst of many _UNK . He is bound as before , and in his mouth there is the _UNK so , with a tight string , making him look almost as if he laughed . " He suggested it , by _UNK his face with his two thumbs , from the corners of his mouth to his ears . " On the top of the gallows is fixed the knife , _UNK upwards , with its point in the air . He is hanged there forty feet _UNK is left hanging , _UNK the water . " They looked at one another , as he used his blue cap to wipe his face , on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the spectacle . " It is frightful , _UNK . How can the women and the children draw water ! Who can _UNK of an evening , under that shadow ! notes it , have I said ? When I left the village , Monday evening as the sun was going to bed , and looked back from the hill , the shadow struck across the church , across the mill , across the _UNK to strike across the earth , _UNK , to where the sky _UNK upon it ! " A hungry man _UNK one of his fingers as he looked at the other three , and his finger quivered with the _UNK that was on him . " That ' s all , _UNK . I left at _UNK ( as I had been warned to do ) , and I walked on , that night and half next day , until I met ( as I was warned I should ) this U . With him , I came on , now _UNK and now walking , through the rest of yesterday and through last night . And here you see me ! " After a gloomy silence , the first _UNK said , " Good ! You have acted and recounted faithfully . Will you wait for us a little , outside the door ? " " Very willingly , " said the _UNK of roads . _UNK _UNK escorted to the top of the stairs , and , leaving seated there , returned . The three had risen , and their heads were together when he came back to the _UNK . " How say you , _UNK ? " demanded from One . " To be _UNK ? " " To be _UNK , as _UNK to destruction , " returned _UNK . " _UNK ! " croaked the man with the _UNK . " The _UNK , and all the race ? " inquired the first . " A _UNK and all the race , " returned _UNK . " _UNK . " The hungry man repeated , in the _UNK _UNK , " _UNK ! " and began _UNK another finger . " Are you sure , " asked _UNK Two , of _UNK , " that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register ? Shortly doubt it is safe , for no one beyond ourselves can _UNK it ; but shall we always be able to _UNK _UNK , I ought to say , will she ? " " _UNK , " returned _UNK , drawing himself up , " if _UNK my wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone , she would not lose a word of the the syllable of it . _UNK , in her own _UNK and her own _UNK , it will always be as plain to her as the sun . suspiciously in _UNK _UNK . It would be _UNK for the weakest _UNK that lives , to _UNK himself from existence , than to _UNK one letter of his name or crimes from the _UNK register of _UNK _UNK . " There was the murmur of confidence and approval , and then a man who _UNK , asked : " Is this monstrous to be sent back soon ? I hope so . He is very simple ; is he not a little dangerous ? " " He knows nothing , " said _UNK ; " at least nothing more than would easily _UNK himself to the gallows of the same height . I charge myself with him ; let him remain with me ; I will take care of him , and set him on his road . He wishes to see a fine _UNK King , the _UNK , and _UNK ; let him see them on Sunday . " " What ? " exclaimed the hungry man , staring . " Is it a good sign , that he wishes to see _UNK and _UNK ? " " _UNK , " said _UNK ; " _UNK show a cat _UNK , if you wish her to _UNK for it . _UNK show the dog his natural prey , if you wish him to bring it down one day . " Nothing more was said , and the _UNK of roads , being found already dozing on the _UNK _UNK , was advised to lay himself down on the _UNK and take some rest . He _UNK no turnpike-road , and was soon asleep . RELATES _Non than _UNK ' s _UNK , could easily have been found in the for a _UNK _UNK of that degree . _UNK for the mysterious dread of _UNK by which he was constantly lairy , his life was very new and agreeable . But , _UNK sat all day at her counter , so _UNK unconscious of him , and so particularly determined not to _UNK that his being there had any connection with anything below the surface , that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her . For , he _UNK with himself that it was impossible to the what that lady might _UNK next ; and he felt assured that if she should take it into her brightly ornamented head to _UNK that she had seen him do a murder and afterwards _UNK the victim , she would infallibly go through with it until the play was played out . _UNK , when Sunday came , the _UNK of roads was not _UNK ( though he said he was ) to find that _UNK was to accompany _UNK and himself to _UNK . It was _UNK _UNK to have _UNK proceeding all the way there , in the public _UNK ; it was _UNK _UNK yet , to have _UNK in the crowd in the afternoon , still with her usual in her hands as the crowd waited to see the carriage of the King and _UNK . " You work hard , _UNK , " said a man near her . " Yes , " answered _UNK _UNK ; " I have a good deal to do . " " What do you make , _UNK ? " " Many things . " " For _UNK " " For instance , " returned _UNK _UNK , composedly , " shrouds . " The man moved a little further away , as soon as he could , and the _UNK of roads _UNK himself with his blue cap : feeling it _UNK close and descending . If he _UNK the King and _UNK to restore him , he was fortunate in having his remedy at hand ; for , soon a _UNK King and the _UNK _UNK came in their _UNK coach , attended by the shining Bull ' s _UNK of their _UNK , the _UNK discharge of laughing ladies and fine lords ; and in jewels and _UNK and powder and splendour and _UNK spurning figures and handsomely _UNK faces of both _UNK , the _UNK of roads bathed himself , so much to his temporary _UNK , that he cried Long live the King , Long live the _UNK , Long live everybody and everything ! as if he had never heard of _UNK _UNK in his time . Then , there were gardens , _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , green banks , more King and _UNK , more Bull ' s _UNK , more lords and ladies , more Long live they all ! until he _UNK wept with sentiment . notes the whole of this scene , which lasted some three hours , he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company , and throughout _UNK held him by the collar , as if to and him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces . " _UNK ! " said _UNK , clapping him on the back when it was over , like the patron ; " you are a good boy ! " The _UNK of roads was now coming to himself , and was _UNK of having made a mistake in his late _UNK ; but no . " You are the fellow we want , " said _UNK , in his ear ; " you make these _UNK believe that it will last for ever . Then , they are a more insolent , and it is a nearer _UNK . " " _UNK ! " cried the _UNK of roads , reflectively ; " that ' s true . " " These _UNK know nothing . While they despise your breath , and would stop it for ever and ever , in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs , they only know what your breath tells them . Let it deceive them , then , a little longer ; it cannot deceive them too much . " _UNK _UNK looked _UNK at the _UNK , and nodded in _UNK . " As to you , " said she , " you would shout and shed tears for anything , if it made a show and the noise . Say ! nudged you not ? " " _UNK , _UNK , I think so . For the moment . " " If you were shown the great heap of _UNK , and were set upon them to . them to pieces and _UNK them for your own advantage , you would pick out the richest and projects . Say ! nudged you not ? " " _UNK yes , _UNK . " " Yes . And if you were shown the flock of birds , unable to fly , and were set upon them to _UNK them of their _UNK for your own advantage , you would set upon the birds of the finest _UNK ; would you not ? " " It is true , _UNK . " " You have seen both _UNK and birds to-day , " said _UNK _UNK , with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent ; " now , go home ! " _UNK . Still _UNK _UNK _UNK and _UNK her husband returned _UNK to the bosom of Saint _UNK , while the hotel in a blue cap toiled through the darkness , and through the dust , and down a weary miles of _UNK by the wayside , slowly _UNK towards that point of a brave where the _UNK of _UNK the _UNK , now in his grave , listened to the whispering trees . Such West leisure had a stone faces , now , for listening to the trees and to the _UNK , that the few village _UNK who , in their device for _UNK to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn , strayed within sight of a great stone _UNK and _UNK staircase , had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered . The rumour just lived in the _UNK a faint and bare existence there , as its people _UNK when the knife struck home , the faces changed , from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain ; also , that when that , figure was ' up forty feet above the _UNK , they changed again , and bore a cruel look of being _UNK , which they would the bear for ever . In a stone face over a great window of the _UNK where the murder was done , two fine _UNK were pointed out in the _UNK nose , which everybody recognised , and which nobody had seen of old ; and on the scarce occasions when two or three ragged _UNK emerged from the crowd to take a hurried peep at _UNK the _UNK _UNK , the skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute , before they all started away among the hair and leaves , like a more fortunate _UNK who could find a living there . _UNK and _UNK , stone face and , figure , a red stain on the stone floor , and the pure water in the village _UNK of _UNK of _UNK whole _UNK of _UNK occasions _UNK under the night sky , concentrated into a faint _UNK line . So does the whole world , with all its _UNK and _UNK , lie in a twinkling _UNK . And as mere human knowledge can split the ray of light and _UNK the manner of its composition , so , _UNK _UNK may read in the feeble shining of this earth of ours , every thought and act , every vice and virtue , of every responsible creature on it . The _UNK , husband and wife , came lumbering under the _UNK , in their public vehicle , to that gate of ' hurried their journey naturally tended . There was the usual _UNK at the _UNK _UNK , and the usual _UNK came glancing forth for the usual examination and inquiry . _UNK _UNK fruitless ; knowing one or two of the _UNK there , and one of the police . The latter he was intimate with , and affectionately dry . When awkward _UNK had again _UNK the _UNK in his dusky _UNK , and they , having finally alighted near the Saint ' s ' , were picking their way on foot through the black mud and setting-in of his streets , _UNK _UNK spoke to her husband : " Say then , my friend ; what did _UNK of the police tell _UNK ? " " Very little to-night , but all he knows . There is another spy _UNK for our quarter . There may be many more , for all that he can say , but he knows of one . " " Eh well ! " said _UNK _UNK , raising her eyebrows with the cool business air . " It is necessary to register him . How do they call that man ? " " He is English . " " So much the better . His name ? " " _UNK , " said _UNK , making it French by _UNK . But , he had been so careful to get it _UNK , that he then spelt it with perfect _UNK . " _UNK , " repeated _UNK . " Good . Christian name ? " " John . " " John _UNK , " repeated _UNK , after _UNK it once to herself . " Good . His appearance ; is it known ? " " _UNK , about forty years ; height , about five feet nine ; black hair ; _UNK dark ; generally , rather handsome _UNK ; eyes dark , face thin , long , and sallow ; nose _UNK , but not straight , having the peculiar inclination towards the left cheek ; expression , therefore , _UNK . " " Eh my _UNK . It is a portrait ! " said _UNK , laughing . " He shall be _UNK to-morrow . " They turned into a _UNK , which was closed ( for it was midnight ) , and where _UNK _UNK immediately took her post at her desk , counted the small _UNK that had been taken during her absence , examined the stock , went through the _UNK in the book , made other _UNK of her own , checked a serving man in every possible way , and finally dismissed him to bed . Then she turned out the contents of a bowl of money for a second time , and began _UNK them up in her handkerchief , in the chain of separate knots , for safe keeping through the night . All this while , _UNK , with his pipe in his mouth , walked up and down , to admiring , but never _UNK ; in which condition , indeed , as to the business and his domestic affairs , he walked up and down through life . A night was hot , and the shop , close shut and surrounded by so _UNK the neighbourhood , was _UNK . _UNK _UNK ' s _UNK sense was by no means delicate , but the stock of wine ' much stronger than it ever tasted , and so did the stock of rum and brandy and _UNK . He _UNK the compound of _UNK away , as he put down his _UNK pipe . " You are fatigued , " said _UNK , raising her glance as she knotted the money . " There are only the usual odours . " " I am a little tired , " her husband acknowledged . " You are a little depressed , too , " said _UNK , whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts , but they had had a ray or two for him . " Oh , the men , the men ! " " But my dear ! " began _UNK . " But my dear ! " repeated _UNK , nodding firmly ; " but my dear ! You are faint of heart to-night , my dear ! " " Well , then , " said _UNK , as if the thought were wrung out of his breast , " it _is_ a long time . " " It is a long time , " repeated his wife ; " and when is it not a long time ? _UNK and _UNK require a long time ; it is the rule . " " It does not take a long time to strike the man with _UNK , " said _UNK . " How long , " demanded _UNK , composedly , " does it take to make and store a lightning ? Tell me . " _UNK raised his head , , as if there were something in that too . " It does not take a long time , " said _UNK , " for an _UNK to swallow the town . INTERVIEW well ! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the _UNK ? " " A long time , I suppose , " said _UNK . " But when it is ready , it takes place , and _UNK to pieces everything before it . In a meantime , it is always preparing , though it is not seen or heard . That is your consolation . Keep it . " She tied a knot with the eyes , as if it throttled the _UNK . " I tell _UNK , " said _UNK , extending her right hand , for emphasis , " that although it is a long time on the road , it is on the road and coming . I tell _UNK it never _UNK , and never stops . I tell _UNK it is always advancing . Look around and consider the lives of all the world that we know , consider the faces of all the world that we know , consider the rage and discontent to which the _UNK _UNK itself with more and more of certainty every hour . patted such things last ? Bah ! I mock you . " " My brave wife , " returned _UNK , standing before her with his head a little bent , and his hands clasped at his back , like a _UNK and attentive pupil before his _UNK , " I do not question all this . But it has lasted a long time , and it is _UNK know well , my wife , it is _UNK it may not come , during our lives . " " Eh well ! How then ? " demanded _UNK , tying another knot , as if there were another enemy _UNK . " Well ! " said _UNK , with a half complaining and half _UNK _UNK . " We shall not see the triumph . " " We shall have helped it , " returned _UNK , with her extended hand in strong action . " Nothing that we do , is done in vain . I believe , with all my soul , that we shall see the triumph . But even if not , even if I knew certainly not , show me the neck of an _UNK and _UNK , and still I would-- " Then _UNK , with her teeth set , tied a very terrible knot indeed . " Hold ! " cried _UNK , reddening a little as if he felt charged with courts ; " I too , my dear , will stop at nothing . " " Yes ! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim and your opportunity , to _UNK you . _UNK yourself without that . When the time comes , let loose the _UNK and the devil ; but wait for the time with a _UNK and the devil _UNK _UNK always ready . " _UNK _UNK the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains out , and then gathering a heavy handkerchief under her arm in the election manner , and observing that it was time to go to bed . FRIENDS _UNK saw the _UNK woman in her usual place in the _UNK , and away assiduously . A rose lay beside her , and if she now and then glanced at a flower , it was with no _UNK of her usual _UNK air . There were a few _UNK , drinking or not drinking , standing or seated , _UNK about . The day was very hot , and heaps of _UNK , who were extending their _UNK and _UNK _UNK into all the _UNK little glasses near _UNK , fell dead at the bottom . Their decease made no impression on the other _UNK out _UNK , who looked at them in the _UNK manner ( as if they themselves were _UNK , or something as far removed ) , until they met the same fate . _UNK to consider how as _UNK are ! _UNK they thought as much at _UNK that sunny summer day . A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on _UNK _UNK which she felt to be a new one . She laid down her ! , and began to pin her rose in her _UNK , before she looked at the figure . It was curious . The moment _UNK _UNK took up the rose , the _UNK ceased talking , and began gradually to drop out of the _UNK . " Good day , _UNK , " said the _UNK . " Good day , _UNK . " She said it aloud , but added to herself , as she resumed her ! : " Hah ! Good day , age about forty , height about five feet nine , black hair , generally rather handsome _UNK , _UNK dark , eyes dark , thin , long and sallow face , _UNK nose but not straight , having the peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts the _UNK expression ! Good day , one and all ! " " Have the goodness to give me the little glass of old _UNK , and the _UNK of cool fresh water , _UNK . " _UNK complied with a polite air . " _UNK _UNK this , _UNK ! " It was the first time it had ever been so _UNK , and _UNK _UNK knew enough of its _UNK to know better . She said , however , that the _UNK was _UNK , and took up her ! . The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments , and took the opportunity of observing the place in general . " You _UNK with great skill , _UNK . " " I am accustomed to it . " " The pretty pattern too ! " " _You_ think so ? " said _UNK , looking at him with a smile . " Decidedly . suspiciously one ask what it is for ? " " _UNK , " said _UNK , still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly . " Not for use ? " " That _UNK . I may find the use for it one day . If I _UNK , " said _UNK , drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of _UNK , " I ' ll use it ! " It was remarkable ; but , the taste of Saint _UNK seemed to be decidedly _UNK to the rose on the _UNK of _UNK _UNK . Two men had entered _UNK , and had been about to order drink , when , catching sight of that novelty , they faltered , made the pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there , and went away . Nor , of those who had been there when this visitor entered , was there one left . They had all dropped off . The spy had kept his eyes open , but had been able to _UNK no sign . They had _UNK away in the _UNK , _UNK , accidental manner , quite natural and _UNK . " _UNK , " thought _UNK , checking off her work as her fingers _UNK , and her eyes looked at the stranger . " Stay long enough , and I shall _UNK ' _UNK ' before you go . " " You have the husband , _UNK ? " " I have . " " _UNK ? " " No children . " " _UNK seems bad ? " " _UNK is very bad ; the people are so poor . " " Ah , a fireplace , miserable people ! So , , _UNK you say . " " As _you_ say , " _UNK retorted , _UNK him , and _UNK ! an extra something into his name that boded him no good . " _UNK me ; certainly it was I who said so , but you naturally think so . Of course . " " _I_ think ? " returned _UNK , in the high voice . " I and my husband have enough to do to keep this _UNK open , without thinking . All we think , here , is how to live . That is the subject _UNK think of , and it gives us , from morning to night , enough to think about , without _UNK our heads concerning others . _I_ think for others ? No , no . " The spy , who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make , did not allow his a state to express itself in his _UNK face ; but , stood with an air of _UNK gallantry , leaning his elbow on _UNK _UNK ' s little counter , and occasionally sipping his _UNK . " The bad business this , _UNK , of _UNK ' s execution . Ah ! a poor _UNK ! " With the sigh of great compassion . " My _UNK ! " returned _UNK , coolly and lightly , " if people use _UNK for such purposes , they have to pay for it . He knew _UNK what a price of his luxury was ; he has paid a price . " " I believe , " said the spy , dropping his soft voice to the tone that invited confidence , and expressing an injured _UNK _UNK in every muscle of his wicked face : " I believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood , touching a poor fellow ? Shortly ourselves . " " Is there ? " asked _UNK , vacantly . " Is there not ? " " _UNK is my husband ! " said _UNK _UNK . As a keeper of the _UNK entered at the door , the spy saluted him by touching his hat , and saying , with an engaging smile , " Good day , _UNK ! " _UNK stopped short , and stared at him . " Good day , _UNK ! " the spy repeated ; with not quite so much confidence , or quite so easy a smile under the stare . " You deceive yourself , _UNK , " returned a keeper of the _UNK . " You mistake me for another . That is not my name . I am _UNK _UNK . " " It is all the same , " said the spy , _UNK , but _UNK too : " good day ! " " Good day ! " answered _UNK , drily . " I was saying to _UNK , with whom I had the pleasure of _UNK when you entered , that they tell me there _UNK no wonder ! _UNK sympathy and anger in Saint _UNK , touching the unhappy fate of poor _UNK . " " No one has told me so , " said _UNK , shaking his head . " I know nothing of it . " Having said it , he passed behind the little counter , and stood with his hand on the back of his wife ' s chair , looking over that _UNK at the person to whom they were both _UNK , and whom either of them would have shot with the greatest satisfaction . The spy , well used to his business , did not change his unconscious attitude , but drained his little glass of _UNK , took a _UNK of fresh water , and asked for another glass of _UNK . _UNK _UNK poured it out for him , took to her usual again , and _UNK a little song over it . " You seem to know this quarter well ; that is to say , better than I do ? " observed _UNK . " Not at all , but I hope to know it better . I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants . " " Hah ! " muttered _UNK . " The pleasure of the with you , _UNK _UNK , _UNK to me , " pursued the spy , " that I have the honour of _UNK some interesting domesticated with your name . " " Indeed ! " said _UNK , with much indifference . " Yes , indeed . When ' _UNK was released , you , his old domestic , had a charge of him , I know . He was delivered to you . You see I am informed of the circumstances ? " " Such is the fact , certainly , " said _UNK . He had had it conveyed to him , in an accidental touch of his wife ' s elbow as she _UNK and _UNK , that he would do best to answer , but always with _UNK . " It was to you , " said the spy , " that his daughter came ; and it was from your care that his daughter took him , accompanied by a neat brown _UNK ; how is he called ? _UNK a little _UNK a bank of _UNK and _UNK to England . " " Such is the fact , " repeated _UNK . " Very interesting remembrances ! " said the spy . " I have known ' _UNK and his daughter , in England . " " Yes ? " said _UNK . " You don ' t hear much about them now ? " said the spy . " No , " said _UNK . " In effect , " _UNK struck in , looking up from her work and her little song , " we never hear about them . We received the news of their safe arrival , and perhaps another letter , or perhaps two ; but , since then , they have gradually taken their road in _UNK , _UNK we have held no _UNK . " " _UNK so , _UNK , " replied the spy . " She is going to be married . " " Going ? " echoed _UNK . " She was pretty enough to have been married long ago . You English are cold , it seems to me . " " Oh ! You know I am English . " " I _UNK your tongue is , " returned _UNK ; " and what a tongue is , I suppose a man is . " He did not take the _UNK as the compliment ; but he made the best of it , and turned it off with a laugh . After sipping his _UNK to the end , he added : " Yes , Miss _UNK is going to be married . But not to an Englishman ; to one who , like herself , is French by birth . And speaking of _UNK ( ah , poor _UNK ! It was cruel , cruel ! ) , it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the _UNK of _UNK the _UNK , for whom _UNK was exalted to that height of so many feet ; in other words , the present _UNK . But he lives unknown in England , he is no _UNK there ; he is Mr . Charles _UNK . D ' _UNK is the name of his mother ' s family . " _UNK _UNK _UNK steadily , but the intelligence had the _UNK effect upon her husband . Do what he would , behind the little counter , as to the striking of the light and a semblance of his pipe , he was troubled , and his hand was not assumed . A spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it , or to record it in his mind . Having made , at least , this one hit , whatever it might prove to be worth , and no _UNK coming in to help him to any other , Mr . _UNK paid for what he had drunk , and took his leave : taking occasion to say , in the genteel manner , before he departed , that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing _UNK and _UNK _UNK again . For some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint _UNK , the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them , lest he should come back . " Can it be true , " said _UNK , in a low voice , looking down at his wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair : " what he has said of _UNK ' _UNK _UNK ? " " As he has said it , " returned _UNK , lifting her eyebrows a little , " it is probably _UNK . But it may be true . " " If it _UNK " _UNK began , and stopped . " If it is ? " repeated his wife . " _UNK if it does come , while we live to see it _UNK hope , for her sake , _UNK will keep her husband out of the . " " Her husband ' s _UNK , " said _UNK _UNK , with her usual occupations , " will take him where he is to go , and will lead him to the end that is to end him . That is all I know . " " But it is very _UNK , at least , is it not very strange " _UNK _UNK , rather _UNK with his wife to induce her to admit it , " that , after all our sympathy for _UNK her father , and herself , her husband ' s name should be _UNK under your hand at this moment , by the side of that infernal dog ' s who has just left us ? " " _UNK things than that will happen when it does come , " answered _UNK . " I have them both here , of the certainty ; and they are both here for their merits ; that is enough . " She rolled up her ! when she had said those words , and presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head . steel wholesome _UNK had an _UNK sense that the _UNK neckcloths was gone , or undertaking _UNK was on the watch for its disappearance ; _UNK , the Saint took courage to _UNK in , very shortly afterwards , and the _UNK recovered its habitual aspect . In the evening , at which proofs of all others Saint _UNK turned himself inside out , and sat on _UNK and _UNK , and came to the corners of vile streets and courts , for a breath of air , _UNK _UNK with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place to place and from group to group : a _UNK were many like _UNK as the world will do well never to of again . All the women _UNK . They _UNK _UNK things ; but , the _UNK work was the _UNK _UNK for eating and drinking ; the hands moved for a flutter and a _UNK and : if a bony fingers had been still , the _UNK would have been more _UNK . But , as a fingers went , the eyes went , and the thoughts . And as _UNK _UNK moved on from group to group , all three went quicker and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with , and left behind . Her husband smoked at his door , looking after her with admiration . " The great woman , " said he , " a strong woman , the _UNK woman , the frightfully _UNK woman ! " emptied closed around , and then came the ringing of church _UNK and a distant beating of the military _UNK in the _UNK _UNK , as a women sat ! , ! . magnificent _UNK them . Another darkness was closing in as surely , when the church _UNK , then ringing pleasantly in many an pull _UNK over , , should be _UNK into thundering _UNK ; when the military _UNK should be beating to drown the wretched voice , that night all _UNK as the voice of Power and _UNK , _UNK and _UNK . So much was closing in about a women who sat ! , ! , that they their very _UNK were closing in around the _UNK yet _UNK , where they were to sit ! , ! , counting dropping heads . _UNK . One _UNK Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in _UNK , than one _UNK evening when a Doctor and his daughter sat under the _UNK together . Never did a moon rise with the _UNK _UNK over great London , than on that night when it found them still seated under a tree , and shone upon their faces through its leaves . _UNK was to be married to-morrow . She had reserved this last evening for her father , and they sat alone under the _UNK . " You are happy , my dear father ? " " Quite , my child . " They had said little , though they had been there a long time . When it was yet light enough to work and read , she had neither engaged herself in her usual work , nor had she read to him . She had employed herself in both ways , at his side under a tree , many and many a time ; but , this time was not quite like any other , and nothing could make it so . " And I am very happy to-night , dear father . I am deeply happy in the love that Heaven has so _UNK love for Charles , and Charles ' s love for me . But , if my life were not to be still _UNK to you , or if my a were so arranged as that it would part us , even by the length of a few of these streets , I should be more unhappy and _UNK now than I can tell you . killed as it _UNK " Even as it was , she could not command her voice . In the sad _UNK , she clasped him by the neck , and laid her face upon his breast . In a _UNK which is always sad , as the light of the sun itself _UNK a light called human life _UNK its coming and its going . " _UNK dear ! Betwixt you tell me , this last time , that you feel quite , quite sure , no new affections of mine , and no new duties of mine , will ever , between us ? _I_ know it well , but do you know it ? In your own heart , do you feel quite certain ? " Her father answered , with the cheerful firmness of . he could scarcely have assumed , " Quite sure , my darling ! More than that , " he added , as he tenderly kissed her : " my future is far brighter , _UNK , seen through your models , than it could have _UNK , than it ever _UNK it . " " If I could hope , , my father ! -- " " Believe it , love ! Indeed it is so . _UNK how natural and how plain it is , my dear , that it should be so . You , devoted and young , cannot fully _UNK the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be _UNK " She moved her hand towards his lips , but he took it in his , and repeated the word . " _UNK , my _UNK not be wasted , struck aside from the natural order of _UNK my sake . Your _UNK cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this ; but , only ask yourself , how could my happiness be perfect , while yours was , ? " " If I had never seen Charles , my father , I should have been quite happy with you . " He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles , having seen him ; and replied : " My child , you did see him , and it is Charles . If it had not been Charles , it would have been another . Or , if it had been no other , I should have been the cause , and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself , and would have fallen on you . " It was the first time , except at the trial , of her ever hearing him _UNK to the period of his suffering . It gave her the strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears ; and she remembered it long afterwards . " See ! " said the Doctor of _UNK , raising his hand towards a moon . " I have looked at her from my _UNK , when I could not bear her light . I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what I had lost , that I have beaten my head against my _UNK . I have looked at her , in a state so dull and _UNK , that I have thought of nothing but a number of _UNK overtake I could draw across her at a full , and a number of _UNK period with which I could _UNK them . " He added in his inward and _UNK manner , as he looked at a moon , " It was twenty either way , I remember , and the _UNK was difficult to _UNK in . " The strange fogle-hunter with which she heard him go back to that time , _UNK as he _UNK upon it ; but , there was nothing to learn her in the manner of his reference . He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the _UNK , that was over . " I have looked at her , _UNK thousands of times upon a _UNK child from whom I had been and . Whether it was alive . Whether it had been born alive , or a poor mother ' s ' had killed it . Whether it was the son who would some day a his father . ( There was the time in my imprisonment , when my desire for ' was _UNK . ) Whether it was a son who would never know his father ' s story ; who might even live to _UNK the possibility of his father ' s having disappeared of his own will and act . Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be the woman . " She drew closer to him , and kissed his cheek and his hand . " I have _UNK my daughter , to myself , as perfectly _UNK of _UNK , altogether ignorant of me , and unconscious of me . I have cast up the years of her age , year after year . I have seen her married to the man who knew nothing of my fate . I have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living , and in the next _UNK my place was a blank . " " My father ! killed to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed , strikes to my heart as if I had been that child . " " You , _UNK ? It is out of the _UNK and _UNK you have brought to me , that these remembrances arise , and pass between us and a moon on this last night . _UNK did I say just now ? " " She knew nothing of you . She _UNK nothing for you . " " So ! But on other _UNK nights , when a sadness and the silence have touched me in a different _UNK affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace , as any emotion that had pain for its impetus _UNK have deposited her as coming to me in my cell , and leading me out into a freedom beyond the _UNK . I have seen her _UNK in the _UNK often , as I now see you ; except that I never held her in my arms ; it stood between the little grated window and the door . But , you understand that that was not a child I am speaking of ? " " A figure was not ; _UNK ; the fancy ? " " No . That was another thing . It stood before my disturbed sense of sight , but it never moved . The the that my mind pursued , was another and more real child . Of her extended appearance I know no more than that she was like her mother . The other had that likeness _UNK you _UNK was not the same . patted you follow me , _UNK ? _UNK , I think ? I doubt you must have been the solitary prisoner to understand these _UNK _UNK . " His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running cold , as he thus tried to _UNK his old condition . " In that more peaceful state , I have deposited her , in a _UNK , coming to me and taking me out to show me that a home of her married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father . My picture was in her room , and I was in her prayers . Her life was active , cheerful , useful ; but my poor history pervaded it all . " " I was that child , my father , I was not half so good , but in my love that was I . " " And she showed me her children , " said the Doctor of _UNK , " and they had heard of me , and had been taught to pity me . When they passed a prison of the State , they kept far from its frowning walls , and looked up at its bars , and spoke in whispers . She could never deliver me ; I excite that she always brought me back after showing me such things . But then , blessed with a relief of tears , I fell upon my knees , and blessed her . " " I am that child , I hope , my father . _UNK my dear , my dear , will you bless me as _UNK to-morrow ? " " _UNK , I recall these old troubles in a reason that I have to-night for loving you better than words can tell , and _UNK God for my great happiness . My thoughts , when they were wildest , never rose near the happiness that I have known with you , and that we have before us . " He a her , solemnly _UNK her to Heaven , and humbly _UNK Heaven for having bestowed her on him . _UNK , they went into the house . There was no one _UNK to a decisive but Mr . _UNK ; there was even to be no _UNK but a gaunt Miss _UNK . A , was to make no change in their place of residence ; they had been able to _UNK it , by taking to themselves the upper rooms suppression _UNK to the _UNK _UNK _UNK , and they desired nothing more . suspiciously _UNK was very cheerful at a little supper . They were only three at table , and Miss _UNK made the third . He _UNK that Charles was not there ; was more than half disposed to object to the loving little plot that kept him away ; and drank to him affectionately . So , the time came for him to bid _UNK good night , and they scuffle . But , in the stillness of the third hour of the morning , _UNK came downstairs again , and stole into his room ; not free from _UNK fears , _UNK . All things , however , were in their places ; all was quiet ; and he lay asleep , his white hair _UNK on the _UNK pillow , and his hands lying quiet on a coverlet . She put her needless candle in the shadow at the distance , crept up to his bed , and put her lips to his ; then , leaned over him , and looked at him . _UNK his handsome face , a bitter _UNK of _UNK had worn ; but , he covered up their tracks with the determination so strong , that he held the _UNK of them even in his sleep . A more remarkable face in its quiet , resolute , and ' struggle with an unseen --Twist , was not to be beheld in all the wide _UNK of sleep , that night . She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast , and put up the prayer that she might ever be as true to him as her love _UNK to be , and as his sorrows , . Then , she withdrew her hand , and kissed his lips once more , and went away . So , the _UNK came , and the shadows of the leaves of a _UNK moved upon his face , as softly as her lips had moved in _UNK for him . _UNK . _UNK _UNK A _UNK was shining brightly , and they were ready outside the closed door of a Doctor ' s room , where he was speaking with Charles _UNK . They were ready to go to church ; the beautiful house-tops , Mr . _UNK , and Miss _UNK whom the event , through a gradual process of _UNK to the _UNK , would have been one of _UNK _UNK , but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother _UNK should have been the _UNK . " And so , " said Mr . _UNK , who could not sufficiently throughout a challenge , and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet , pretty dress ; " and so it was for this , my sweet _UNK , that I brought you across the _UNK , such a finances ! Lord bless me ! How little I thought what I was doing ! How lightly I _UNK the _UNK I was _UNK on my friend Mr . Charles ! " " You didn ' t mean it , " remarked a _UNK Miss _UNK , " and therefore how could you know it ? Nonsense ! " " ' ? Well ; but don ' t cry , " said the gentle Mr . _UNK . " I am not crying , " said Miss _UNK ; " _you_ are . " " I , my _UNK ? " ( By this time , Mr . _UNK dared to be pleasant with her , on occasion . ) " You were , just now ; I saw you do it , and I don ' t wonder at it . Such the present of plate as you have made ' em , is enough to bring tears into anybody ' s eyes . There ' s not a fork or the spoon in a collection , " said Miss _UNK , " that I didn ' t cry over , last night after the box came , till I couldn ' t see it . " " I am highly gratified , " said Mr . _UNK , " though , upon my honour , I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance _UNK to any one . Dear me ! This is an occasion that makes a man _UNK on all he has lost . Dear , dear , dear ! To think that there might have been the Mrs . _UNK , any time these fifty years almost ! " " Not at all ! " From Miss _UNK . " You think there never might have been the Mrs . _UNK ? " asked a gentleman of that name . " Pooh ! " rejoined Miss _UNK ; " you were a bachelor in your cradle . " " Well ! " observed Mr . _UNK , _UNK adjusting his little wig , " that seems probable , too . " " And you were cut out for a bachelor , " pursued Miss _UNK , " before you were put in your cradle . " " Then , I think , " said Mr . _UNK , " that I was very _UNK dealt with , and that I ought to have had a voice in the _UNK of my pattern . _UNK ! Now , my dear _UNK , " drawing his arm soothingly round her waist , " I hear them moving in the next room , and Miss _UNK and I , as two formal folks of business , are anxious not to lose a final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear . You leave your good father , my dear , in hands as earnest and as loving as your own ; he shall be taken every _UNK care of ; during the next fortnight , while you are in _UNK and space , even _UNK ' s shall go to the wall ( comparatively speaking ) before him . And when , at a fortnight ' s end , he comes to join you and your beloved husband , on your other fortnight ' s _UNK in , , you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the _UNK frame . Now , I hear Somebody ' s step coming to the door . Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing , before Somebody comes to claim his own . " For a moment , he held the fair face from him to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead , and then laid the bright _UNK hair against his little brown wig , with the genuine tenderness and _UNK which , if such things be old-fashioned , were as old as _UNK . The door of a Doctor ' s room opened , and he came out with Charles _UNK . He was so deadly _UNK had not been the case when they went in _UNK no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face . But , in the odour of his manner he was _UNK , except that to a shrewd glance of Mr . _UNK it disclosed some shadowy the that the old air of _UNK and dread had lately passed over him , like a cold wind . He gave his arm to his daughter , and took her _UNK to the chariot which Mr . _UNK had _UNK in honour of the day . A rest followed in another carriage , and soon , in a neighbouring church , where no strange eyes looked on , Charles _UNK and _UNK _UNK were happily married . Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done , some _UNK , very bright and sparkling , glanced on the of-- ' s hand , which were _UNK released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr . _UNK ' s pockets . They returned home to breakfast , and all went well , and in due course the _UNK hair that had mingled with a poor _UNK ' s white locks in the , _UNK , were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight , on the _UNK of the door at parting . It was a hard parting , though it was not for long . But her father _UNK her , and said at last , gently disengaging himself from her _UNK arms , " Take her , Charles ! She is yours ! " And her agitated hand waved to them from the chaise window , and she was gone . The corner being out of the way of a idle and curious , and the preparations having been very simple and few , the Doctor , Mr . _UNK , and Miss _UNK , were left quite alone . It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall , that Mr . _UNK observed a great change to have come over the Doctor ; as if the _UNK arm _UNK there , had struck him the ivy blow . He had naturally a much , and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for _UNK was gone . But , it was a old arch lost look that troubled Mr . _UNK ; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and _UNK wandering away into his own room when they got _UNK , Mr . _UNK was reminded of _UNK a _UNK keeper , and the _UNK ride . " I think , " he whispered to Miss _UNK , after anxious consideration , " I think we had best not speak to him just now , or at all disturb him . I must look in at _UNK ' s ; so I will go there at once and come back presently . Then , we will take him the ride into the country , and _UNK there , and all will be well . " It was _UNK for Mr . _UNK to look in at _UNK ' s , than to look out of _UNK ' s . He was the two hours . When he came back , he ascended the old staircase alone , having asked no question of the servant ; going thus into a Doctor ' s rooms , he was stopped by a low sound of knocking . " Good God ! " he said , with a start . " What ' s that ? " Miss _UNK , with the terrified face , was at his ear . " _UNK me , _UNK me ! All is lost ! " cried she , wringing her hands . " What is to be told to _UNK ? He doesn ' t know me , and is making shoes ! " Mr . _UNK said what he could to calm her , and went himself into a Doctor ' s room . The bench was turned towards the light , as it had been when he had seen the _UNK at his work before , and his head was bent down , and he was very busy . " Doctor _UNK . My dear friend , ' _UNK ! " The Doctor looked at him for the _UNK _UNK , half as if he were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again . He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat ; his shirt was open at the throat , as it used to be when he did that work ; and even the old haggard , faded surface of face had come back to him . He worked _UNK if in some sense of having been interrupted . Mr . _UNK glanced at the work in his hand , and observed that it was the _UNK of the old size and shape . He took up another that was lying by him , and asked what it was . " The young lady ' s walking _UNK , " he muttered , without looking up . " It ought to have been finished long ago . Let it be . " " But , ' _UNK . Look at me ! " He obeyed , in the old mechanically _UNK manner , without pausing in his work . " You know me , my dear friend ? Think again . This is not your proper occupation . Think , dear friend ! " Nothing would induce him to speak more . He looked up , for an instant at the time , when he was requested to do so ; but , no shilling would played the word from him . He worked , and worked , and worked , in silence , and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an _UNK wall , or on the air . A only ray of hope that Mr . _UNK could discover , was , that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked . In that , there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or _UNK though he were trying to _UNK some doubts in his mind . Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr . _UNK , as important above all others ; the first , that this must be kept secret from _UNK ; the second , that it must be kept secret from all who knew him . In _UNK with Miss _UNK , he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution , by giving out that the Doctor was not well , and required a few days of complete rest . In aid of the kind deception to be _UNK on his daughter , Miss _UNK was to write , _UNK his having been called away , , and pausing to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried period in his own hand , represented to have been addressed to her by the same post . These _UNK , advisable to be taken in any case , Mr . _UNK took in the hope of his coming to himself . If that should happen soon , he kept another course in reserve ; which was , to have a certain opinion that he thought the best , on a Doctor ' s case . In a hope of his recovery , and of , to this third course being thereby rendered _UNK , Mr . _UNK resolved to watch him attentively , with as little appearance as possible of doing so . He therefore made arrangements to absent himself from _UNK ' s for the first time in his life , and took his post by the window in the same room . He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him , since , on being pressed , he became , . He illusion that attempt on the first day , and resolved merely to keep himself always before him , as a silent _UNK against the _UNK into which he had fallen , or was falling . He remained , therefore , in his seat near the window , reading and writing , and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of , that it was the free place . vast _UNK took what was given him to eat and drink , and worked on , that first day , until it was too dark to _UNK on , half an hour after Mr . _UNK could not have seen , for his life , to read or write . When he put his tools aside as useless , until morning , Mr . _UNK rose and said to him : " Will you go out ? " He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner , looked up in the old manner , and repeated in the old low voice : " Out ? " " Yes ; for the walk with me . Why not ? " He made no effort to say why not , and said not a word more . But , Mr . _UNK thought he saw , as he leaned forward on his bench in a dusk , with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands , that he was in some misty way asking himself , " Why not ? " A _UNK of a man of business perceived an advantage here , and determined to hold it . Miss _UNK and he divided the night into two watches , and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room . He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down ; but , when he did finally lay himself down , he fell asleep . In the morning , he was up suppression , and went straight to his bench and to work . On this second day , Mr . _UNK saluted him cheerfully by his name , and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them . He returned no reply , but it was evident that he heard what was said , and that he thought about it , however _UNK . This encouraged Mr . _UNK to have Miss _UNK in with her work , several times during the day ; at those times , they quietly spoke of _UNK , and of her father then present , precisely in the usual manner , and as if there were nothing amiss . This was done without any _UNK _UNK , not long enough , or often enough to _UNK him ; and it _UNK Mr . _UNK ' s friendly heart to believe that he looked up _UNK , and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of _UNK surrounding him . When it fell dark again , Mr . _UNK asked him as before : " Dear Doctor , will you go out ? " As before , he repeated , " Out ? " " Yes ; for the walk with me . Why not ? " This time , Mr . _UNK _UNK to go out when he could extract no answer from him , and , after remaining absent for an hour , returned . In the meanwhile , the Doctor had removed to a seat in the window , and had sat there looking down at the _UNK ; but , on Mr . _UNK ' s return , he slipped away to his bench . The time went very slowly on , and Mr . _UNK ' s hope darkened , and his heart grew heavier again , and grew yet heavier and heavier every day . The third day came and went , the fourth , the _UNK . _UNK days , six days , seven days , eight days , nine days . With the hope ever _UNK , and with the heart always growing heavier and heavier , Mr . _UNK passed through this anxious time . The secret was well kept , and _UNK was unconscious and happy ; but he could not fail to observe that the _UNK , whose hand had been a little out at first , was growing dreadfully skilful , and that he had never been so intent on his work , and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert , as in the dusk of the ninth evening . _UNK . An _UNK _UNK out by anxious watching , Mr . _UNK fell asleep at his post . On the _UNK morning of his suspense , he was startled by the shining of the sun into a room where the heavy forward--in had overtaken him when it was dark night . He rubbed his eyes and roused himself ; but he _UNK , when he had done so , whether he was not still asleep . For , going to the door of a Doctor ' s room and looking in , he perceived that the _UNK ' s bench and tools were put aside again , and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window . He was in his usual morning dress , and his face ( which Mr . _UNK could distinctly see ) , though still very pale , was _UNK _UNK and attentive . Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake , Mr . _UNK felt _UNK uncertain for some few moments whether a late _UNK might not be the disturbed dream of his own ; for , did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect , and employed as usual ; and was there any sign within their range , that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened ? It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment , a answer being obvious . If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause , how came he , _UNK _UNK , there ? How came he to have fallen asleep , in his clothes , on a sofa in Doctor _UNK ' s _UNK , and to be _UNK these points outside a Doctor ' s bedroom door in a early morning ? elevating a few minutes , Miss _UNK stood whispering at his side . If he had had any _UNK of doubt left , her talk would of necessity have resolved it ; but he was by that time _UNK , and had none . He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular _UNK , and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred . If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind , Mr . _UNK would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and _UNK from the opinion he had been , in his anxiety , so anxious to obtain . Miss _UNK , _UNK herself to his judgment , the scullery was worked out with care . Having abundance of time for his usual _UNK _UNK , Mr . _UNK presented himself at the _UNK in his usual white linen , and with his usual neat leg . A Doctor was summoned in the usual way , and came to breakfast . So far as it was possible to comprehend him without _UNK those delicate and gradual , which Mr . _UNK felt to be the only safe advance , he at first supposed that his daughter ' s ' had taken place yesterday . An incidental allusion , bony thrown out , to the day of a week , and the day of a month , set him thinking and counting , and evidently made him uneasy . In all other respects , however , he was so composedly himself , that Mr . _UNK determined to have the aid he sought . And that aid was his own . _UNK , when the breakfast was done and cleared away , and he and the Doctor were left together , Mr . _UNK said , _UNK : " My dear _UNK , I am anxious to have your opinion , in confidence , on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested ; that is to say , it is very curious to me ; perhaps , to your better information it may be less so . " _UNK at his hands , which were discoloured by his late work , the Doctor looked troubled , and listened attentively . He had already glanced at his hands more than once . " Doctor _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , touching him affectionately on the arm , " the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine . Pray give your mind to it , and advise me well for his _UNK above all , for his daughter ' _UNK daughter ' s , my dear _UNK . " " If I understand , " said the Doctor , in a subdued tone , " some mental _UNK ? " " Yes ! " " Be fogels , " said the Doctor . " _UNK no commons . " Mr . _UNK saw that they understood one another , and proceeded . " My dear _UNK , it is the case of an old and a prolonged ' , of great acuteness and severity to the affections , the feelings , _UNK you express _UNK mind . The mind . It is the case of the ferry-house under which the _UNK was borne down , one cannot say for how long , because I believe he cannot _UNK a time himself , and there are no other means of getting at it . It is the case of a volumes from which the _UNK recovered , by a process that he cannot trace _UNK I once heard him , relate in the striking manner . It is the case of a volumes from which he has recovered , so completely , as to be a highly intelligent man , capable of close application of mind , and great exertion of body , and of constantly making fresh _UNK to his stock of knowledge , which was already very large . But , unfortunately , there has been , " he paused and took a deep _UNK " a slight _UNK . " The Doctor , in a low voice , asked , " Of how long duration ? " " _UNK days and nights . " " How did it show itself ? I _UNK , " glancing at his hands again , " in the _UNK of some old pursuit connected with the wages ? " " That is the fact . " " Now , did you ever see him , " asked the Doctor , distinctly and collectedly , though in the same low voice , " engaged in that pursuit originally ? " " Once . " " And when the _UNK fell on him , was he in most _UNK in all _UNK he was then ? " " I think in all respects . " " You spoke of his daughter . elevating his daughter know of the _UNK ? " " No . It has been kept from her , and I hope will always be kept from her . It is known only to myself , and to one other who may be trusted . " The Doctor grasped his hand , and murmured , " That was very kind . That was very thoughtful ! " Mr . _UNK grasped his hand in return , and neither of the two spoke for a little while . " Now , my dear _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , at length , in his most a and most affectionate way , " I am a mere man of business , and unfit to _UNK with such intricate and difficult matters . I do not possess a kind of information necessary ; I do not possess a kind of intelligence ; I want _UNK . There is no man in this world on whom I could so the for right _UNK , as on you . Tell me , how does this _UNK come about ? Is there danger of another ? inspect the repetition of it be prevented ? How should the repetition of it be treated ? How does it come about at all ? What can I do for my friend ? No man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend , than I am to serve mine , if I knew how . " But I don ' t know how to originate , in such the case . If your _UNK , knowledge , and experience , could put me on the right track , I might be able to do so much ; _UNK and _UNK , I can do so little . Pray crushed it with me ; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly , and teach me how to be a little more useful . " Stone _UNK sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken , and Mr . _UNK did not press him . " I think it probable , " said a Doctor , breaking silence with an effort , " that the _UNK you have described , my dear friend , was not quite _UNK by its subject . " " Was it dreaded by him ? " Mr . _UNK ventured to ask . " Very much . " He said it with an involuntary shudder . " You have no idea how such an apprehension _UNK on the _UNK ' s mind , and how _UNK almost _UNK is , for him to force himself to utter a word upon the _UNK that _UNK him . " " Would he , " asked Mr . _UNK , " be _UNK relieved if he could _UNK upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one , when it is on him ? " " I think so . But it is , as I have told you , next to impossible . I even believe _UNK some _UNK be quite impossible . " " Now , " said Mr . _UNK , gently laying his hand on the Doctor ' s arm again , after a short silence on both sides , " to what would you _UNK this attack ? " " I believe , " returned Doctor _UNK , " that there had been a strong and extraordinary _UNK of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the _UNK . Some intense advantages of the most _UNK nature were _UNK recalled , I think . It is probable that there had long been a dread the in his mind , that those monstrous would be _UNK , under certain _UNK , on the particular occasion . He tried to prepare himself in vain ; perhaps a effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it . " " Would he remember what took place in the _UNK ? " asked Mr . _UNK , with natural hesitation . The Doctor looked _UNK round the room , shook his head , and answered , in a low voice , " Not at all . " " Now , as to the future , " hinted Mr . _UNK . " As to the future , " said the Doctor , recovering firmness , " I should have great hope . As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon , I should have great hope . He , yielding under the pressure of the complicated something , long dreaded and long _UNK _UNK and _UNK against , and recovering after a cloud had burst and passed , I should hope that the worst was over . " " Well , well ! That ' s good comfort . I am thankful ! " said Mr . _UNK . " I am thankful ! " repeated the Doctor , bending his head with goblin . " There are two other points , " said Mr . _UNK , " on which I am anxious to be instructed . I may go on ? " " You cannot do your friend the better service . " The Doctor gave him his hand . " To the first , then . He is of the _UNK habit , and unusually _UNK ; he _UNK himself with great a to a characteristics of professional knowledge , to the _UNK of _UNK , to many things . Now , does he do too much ? " " I think not . It may be the character of his mind , to be always in singular need of occupation . That may be , in part , natural to it ; in part , the result of affliction . A less it was occupied with healthy things , the more it would be in danger of turning in the _UNK direction . He may have observed himself , and made the discovery . " " You are sure that he is not under too great a strain ? " " I think I am quite sure of it . " " My dear _UNK , if he were _UNK _UNK " " My dear _UNK , I doubt if that could easily be . There has been a violent stress in one direction , and it disputing--for a _UNK . " " _UNK me , as a _UNK man of business . _UNK for a moment , that he _was_ _UNK ; it would show itself in some guardianship of this disorder ? " " I do not think so . I do not think , " said Doctor _UNK with the firmness of _UNK , " that anything but the one train of _UNK would the it . I think that , d--me , nothing but some extraordinary _UNK of that chord could the it . After what has happened , and after his recovery , I find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again . I trust , and I almost believe , that the circumstances likely to the it are exhausted . " He spoke with the _UNK of the man who knew how slight the thing would _UNK a delicate _UNK of the mind , and yet with the confidence of the man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal doubles and distress . It was not for his friend to _UNK that confidence . He _UNK himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was , and approached his second and last point . He felt it to be the most difficult of all ; but , remembering his old Sunday morning conversation with Miss _UNK , and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days , he knew that he must face it . " The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from , " said Mr . _UNK , clearing his throat , " we will _UNK ' s work , _UNK ' s work . We will say , to put the case and for the sake of illustration , that he had been used , in his bad time , to work at a little _UNK . We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his _UNK again . Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him ? " The Doctor _UNK his forehead with his hand , and beat his foot nervously on the ground . " He has always kept it by him , " said Mr . _UNK , with an anxious look at his friend . " Now , would it not be better that he should let it go ? " Still , the Doctor , with _UNK forehead , beat his foot nervously on the ground . " You do not find it easy to advise me ? " said Mr . _UNK . " I quite understand it to be a nice question . And yet I _UNK " And there he shook his head , and stopped . " You see , " said Doctor _UNK , turning to him after an uneasy pause , " it is very hard to explain , _UNK , the innermost _UNK of this poor man ' s mind . He once _UNK so frightfully for that occupation , and it was so welcome when it came ; no doubt it relieved his pain so much , by , the perplexity of a fingers for the perplexity of the brain , and by , , as he became more _UNK , the ingenuity of the hands , for the ingenuity of the mental torture ; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach . Even now , when I believe he is more , of himself than he has ever been , and even ' of himself with a kind of confidence , the idea that he might need that old employment , and not find it , gives him a sudden sense of terror , like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of the lost child . " He looked like his illustration , as he raised his eyes to Mr . _UNK ' s face . " But may _UNK ! I ask for information , as a post-boys man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas , shillings , and _UNK not the _UNK of the thing involve the _UNK of the idea ? If a thing were gone , my dear _UNK , might not the fear go with it ? In short , is it not the window-recess to the _UNK , to keep the _UNK ? " There was another silence . " You see , too , " said the Doctor , _UNK , " it is such an old companion . " " I would not keep it , " said Mr . _UNK , shaking his head ; for he gained in firmness as he saw the Doctor _UNK . " I would recommend him to sacrifice it . I only want your authority . I am sure it does no good . Come ! Give me your authority , like a dear good man . For his daughter ' s sake , my dear _UNK ! " Very strange to see what the struggle there was within him ! " In her name , then , let it be done ; I sanction it . But , I would not take it away while he was present . Let it be removed when he is not there ; let him miss his old companion after an absence . " Mr . _UNK readily engaged for that , and a conference was _UNK . They passed a day in the country , and the Doctor was quite restored . On the three following days he remained perfectly well , and on the _UNK day he went away to join _UNK and her husband . A machinery that had been taken to account for his silence , Mr . _UNK had previously explained to him , and he had written to _UNK in _UNK with it , and she had no suspicions . On the night of a day on which he left the house , Mr . _UNK went into his room with the _UNK , saw , _UNK , and hammer , attended by Miss _UNK carrying the light . There , with closed doors , and in a mysterious and guilty manner , Mr . _UNK _UNK a _UNK ' s bench to pieces , while Miss _UNK held a candle as if she were assisting at the _UNK which , indeed , in her _UNK , she was no _UNK figure . The burning of the body ( previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose ) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire ; and the tools , shoes , and brooches , were buried in the garden . So counterfeit do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds , that Mr . _UNK and Miss _UNK , while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the mysteries of its traces , almost felt , and almost looked , like _UNK in a horrible crime . _UNK . The _UNK When a _UNK pair came home , the first person who appeared , to offer his _UNK , was _UNK _UNK . They had not been at home many hours , when he presented himself . He was not improved in habits , or in looks , or in manner ; but there was a certain _UNK air of _UNK about him , which was new to a observation of Charles _UNK . He watched his opportunity of taking _UNK aside into the window , and of speaking to him when no one overheard . " Mr . _UNK , " said _UNK , " I wish we might be friends . " " We are already friends , I hope . " " You are good enough to say so , as the openness of speech ; but , I don ' t mean any fashion of speech . Indeed , when I say I wish we might be friends , I scarcely mean quite that , either . " Charles _UNK was _UNK him , in all good-humour and _UNK , what he did mean ? " Upon my life , " said _UNK , smiling , " I find that _UNK to comprehend in my own mind , than to convey to yours . However , let me try . You remember a certain the occasion when I was more drunk _UNK usual ? " " I remember a certain the occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking . " " I remember it too . The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me , for I always remember them . I hope it may be taken into account one day , when all days are at an end for me ! Don ' t be alarmed ; I am not going to _UNK . " " I am not at all alarmed . _UNK in you , is anything but alarming to me . " " Ah ! " said _UNK , with a careless wave of his hand , as if he waved that away . " On a drunken occasion in question ( one of a large number , as you know ) , I was _UNK about liking you , and not liking you . I wish you would forget it . " " I forgot it long ago . " " _UNK of speech again ! But , Mr . _UNK , _UNK is not so easy to me , as you inwented it to be to you . I have by no means forgotten it , and a light answer does not help me to forget it . " " If it was a light answer , " returned _UNK , " I beg your _UNK for it . I had no other object than to turn a slight thing , which , to my surprise , seems to trouble you too much , aside . I declare to you , on the _UNK of the gentleman , that I have long dismissed it from my mind . Good Heaven , what was there to _UNK ! Have I had nothing more important to remember , in a great service you rendered me that day ? " " As to the great service , " said _UNK , " I am bound to _UNK to you , when you speak of it in that way , that it was mere professional _UNK , I don ' t know that I _UNK what became of you , when I rendered it . _UNK ! I say when I rendered it ; I am speaking of the past . " " You make light of the _UNK , " returned _UNK , " but I will not quarrel with _UNK light answer . " " _UNK truth , Mr . _UNK , trust me ! I have gone aside from my purpose ; I was speaking about our being friends . Now , you know me ; you know I am incapable of all a higher and better the of men . If you doubt it , ask _UNK , and he ' ll tell you so . " " I prefer to form my own opinion , without the aid of his . " " Well ! At any rate you know me as the ' dog , who has never done any good , and never will . " " I don ' t know that you ' never will . ' " " But I do , and you must take my word for it . Well ! If you could _UNK to have such a _UNK fellow , and the fellow of such _UNK reputation , coming and going at odd times , I should ask that I might be permitted to come and go as the _UNK person here ; that I might be regarded as an useless ( and I would add , if it were not for the resemblance I _UNK between you and me , an _UNK ) piece of furniture , _UNK for its old service , and taken no notice of . I doubt if I should ; the permission . It is a hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in the year . It would satisfy me , I dare say , to know that I had it . " " Will you try ? " " That is another way of saying that I am placed on a footing I have indicated . I thank you , _UNK . I may use that freedom with your name ? " " I think so , _UNK , by this time . " They shook hands upon it , and _UNK turned away . elevating a minute afterwards , he was , to all . appearance , as _UNK as ever . When he was gone , and in the course of an evening passed with Miss _UNK , the Doctor , and Mr . _UNK , Charles _UNK made some mention of this conversation in general terms , and spoke of _UNK _UNK as the _UNK of ' and recklessness . He spoke of him , in short , not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him , but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself . He had no idea that this could dwell in a thoughts of his fair young wife ; but , when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms , he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked . " We are thoughtful to-night ! " said _UNK , drawing his arm about her . " Yes , dearest Charles , " with her hands on his breast , and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him ; " we are rather thoughtful to-night , for we have something on our mind to-night . " " What is it , my _UNK ? " " Will you promise not to press one question on me , if I beg you not to ask it ? " " Will I promise ? What will I not promise to my _UNK ? " What , indeed , with his hand putting aside a _UNK hair from the cheek , and his other hand against the heart that beat for him ! " I think , Charles , poor Mr . _UNK deserves more consideration and respect than you expressed for him to-night . " " Indeed , my own ? Why so ? " " That is what you are not to ask me . But I _UNK _UNK does . " " If you know it , it is enough . What would you have me do , my _UNK ? " " I would ask you , dearest , to be very generous with him always , and very _UNK on his faults when he is not by . I would ask you to believe that he has the heart he very , very seldom _UNK , and that there are deep wounds in it . My dear , I have seen it bleeding . " " It is a painful reflection to me , " said Charles _UNK , quite astounded , " that I should have done him any wrong . I never thought this of him . " " My husband , it is so . I fear he is not to be that ; there is scarcely the hope that anything in his character or fortunes is _UNK now . But , I am sure that he is capable of good things , gentle things , even _UNK things . " She looked so beautiful in the _UNK of her _UNK in this lost man , that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours . " And , _UNK my dearest _UNK ! " she urged , clinging nearer to him , laying her head upon his breast , and raising her eyes to his , " remember how strong we are in our happiness , and how weak he is in his misery ! " The supplication touched him home . " I will always remember it , dear _UNK ! I will remember it as long as I live . " He bent over the _UNK head , and put the _UNK lips to his , and folded her in his arms . If one _UNK _UNK then pacing the dark streets , could have heard her innocent disclosure , and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from a soft blue eyes so loving of that husband , he might have cried to the _UNK the words would not have parted from his lips for the first _UNK " God bless her for her sweet compassion ! " _UNK . _UNK _UNK A wonderful corner for _UNK , it has been remarked , that corner where the Doctor lived . _UNK busily winding a _UNK her which bound her husband , and her father , and herself , and her old _UNK and companion , in the life of quiet _UNK , _UNK sat in the still house in the _UNK _UNK corner , listening to the _UNK footsteps of years . At first , there were times , though she was a perfectly happy young wife , when her work would slowly fall from her hands , and her eyes would be dimmed . For , there was something coming in the _UNK , something light , _UNK off , and scarcely audible yet , that stirred her heart too much . _UNK hopes and _UNK , of the love as yet unknown to her : doubts , of her remaining upon earth , to . that new _UNK her breast . inspect a _UNK then , there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave ; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate , and who would _UNK for her so much , swelled to her eyes , and broke like _UNK . That time passed , and her little _UNK lay on her bosom . Then , among the advancing _UNK , there was a tread of her _UNK feet and the sound of her _UNK words . Let greater _UNK _UNK as they would , the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming . They came , and a shady house was sunny with the child ' s laugh , and a _UNK friend of children , to whom in her trouble she had confided hers , seemed to take her child in his arms , as He took a child of old , and made it a sufficiency joy to her . _UNK busily winding the _UNK the that bound them all together , _UNK the service of her happy influence through the _UNK of all their lives , and making it _UNK nowhere , _UNK heard in the _UNK of years none but friendly and soothing sounds . Her husband ' s step was strong and _UNK among them ; her father ' s firm and equal . _UNK , Miss _UNK , in _UNK of string , awakening the _UNK , as an _UNK _UNK , _UNK , _UNK and _UNK the earth under the _UNK in the garden ! Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest , they were not harsh nor cruel . Even when _UNK hair , like her own , lay in a _UNK on the pillow round the worn face of a little boy , and he said , with a monstrous smile , " Dear _UNK and _UNK , I am very sorry to leave you both , and to leave my pretty sister ; but I am called , and I must go ! " those were not tears all of agony that _UNK his young mother ' s cheek , as a spirit departed from her embrace that had been _UNK to it . _UNK them and forbid them not . They see my _UNK ' s face . _UNK _UNK , blessed words ! Thus , a rustling of an Angel ' s _UNK got blended with the other _UNK , and they were not wholly of earth , but had in them that breath of Heaven . _UNK of the winds that blew over a little _UNK were mingled with them also , and both were audible to _UNK , in the hushed _UNK the odour of the summer sea asleep upon the _UNK _UNK a little _UNK , _UNK _UNK at the task of the morning , or it--if a _UNK at her mother ' s _UNK , chattered in the _UNK of a Two _UNK that were blended in her life . The _UNK _UNK answered to a actual tread of _UNK _UNK . Some half-dozen times the year , at most , he _UNK his _UNK of coming in _UNK , and would sit among them through the evening , as he had once done often . He never came there heated with wine . And one other thing regarding him was whispered in a _UNK , which has been whispered by all true _UNK for ages and ages . No man ever really loved a woman , lost her , and knew her with a _UNK though an unchanged mind , when she was a wife and a mother , but her children had the strange sympathy with _UNK _UNK _UNK of pity for him . What fine hidden _UNK are touched in such the case , no _UNK tell ; but it is so , and it was so here . _UNK was the first stranger to whom little _UNK held out her _UNK arms , and he kept his place with her as she grew . The little boy had spoken of him , almost at the last . " Poor _UNK ! Kiss him for me ! " Mr . _UNK shouldered his way through the law , like some great a forcing itself through turbid water , and dragged his useful friend in his wake , like a boat _UNK _UNK . As a boat so favoured is usually in a rough _UNK , and _UNK under water , so , _UNK had the _UNK life of it . But , easy and strong custom , _UNK so much _UNK and stronger in him than any _UNK sense of desert or disgrace , made it the life he was to lead ; and he no more thought of emerging from his state of _UNK ' s _UNK , than any real _UNK may be supposed to think of rising to be a _UNK . _UNK was rich ; had married a _UNK , with property and three boys , who had nothing particularly shining about them but the straight hair of their _UNK heads . These three young gentlemen , Mr . _UNK , _UNK patronage of the most nimble the from every ' , had walked before him like three sheep to the quiet corner in _UNK , and had offered as pupils to _UNK ' s husband : _UNK saying " Halloa ! here are three _UNK of _UNK towards your matrimonial _UNK , _UNK ! " The polite _UNK of the three _UNK of _UNK had quite _UNK Mr . _UNK with indignation , which he afterwards turned to account in the training of the young gentlemen , by directing them to _UNK of the pride of _UNK , like that _UNK . He was also in the habit of _UNK to Mrs . _UNK , over his _UNK wine , on a the Mrs . _UNK had once put in practice to " catch " him , and on the _UNK , in himself , _UNK , which had rendered him " not to be caught . " Some of his King ' s candles _UNK , who were occasionally parties to the _UNK wine and a lie , excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often , that he believed it _UNK is surely such an incorrigible the of an originally bad offence , as to justify any such offender ' s being carried off to some _UNK retired spot , and there hanged out of the way . These were among the _UNK to which _UNK , sometimes _UNK , sometimes amused and laughing , listened in a _UNK corner , until her little daughter was six years old . How near to her heart the _UNK of her child ' s tread came , and those of her own dear father ' s , always active and _UNK , and those of her dear husband ' s , need not be told . Nor , how the _UNK echo of their united home , directed by herself with such a wise and elegant _UNK that it was more _UNK than any , , was music to her . Nor , how there were _UNK all about her , sweet in her ears , of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married ( if that could be ) than single , and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to convey her love for him or her help to him , and asked her " What is a magic secret , my darling , of your being everything to all of us , as if there were only one of us , yet never seeming to be hurried , or to have too much to do ? " But , there were other _UNK , from the distance , that _UNK _UNK in a corner all through this space of time . And it was now , about little _UNK ' s _UNK birthday , that they began to have an awful sound , as of a great _UNK in the with the dreadful sea rising . On the night in _UNK , one thousand seven hundred and _UNK , Mr . _UNK came in late , from _UNK ' s , and sat himself down by _UNK and her husband in the dark window . It was a hot , wild night , and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at a lightning from the same place . " I began to think , " said Mr . _UNK , pushing his brown wig back , " that I should have to pass the night at _UNK ' s . We have been so full of business all day , that we have not known what to do first , or which way to turn . There is such an _UNK in , , that we have actually a run of confidence upon us ! _UNK _UNK over there , seem not to be able to _UNK their property to us fast enough . There is positively the _UNK among some of them for sending it to England . " " That has a bad look , " said _UNK " A bad look , you say , my dear _UNK ? Yes , but we don ' t know what reason there is in it . ready-dressed are so unreasonable ! Some of us at _UNK ' s are getting old , and we really can ' t be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion . " " Still , " said _UNK , " you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is . " " I know that , to be sure , " _UNK Mr . _UNK , trying to _UNK himself that his sweet temper was _UNK , and that he _UNK , " but I am determined to be truly after my long day ' s _UNK . Where is _UNK ? " " Here he is , " said the Doctor , entering the dark room at the moment . " I am quite glad you are at home ; for these _UNK and _UNK by which I have been surrounded all day long , have made me nervous without reason . You are not going out , I hope ? " " No ; I am going to play _UNK with you , if you like , " said the Doctor . " I don ' t think I do like , if I may speak my mind . I am not fit to be _UNK against you to-night . Is the _UNK still there , _UNK ? I can ' t see . " " Of course , it has been kept for you . " " Thank ye , my dear . The precious child is safe in bed ? " " And sleeping needle-work . " " That ' s right ; all safe and well ! I don ' t know why anything should be otherwise than safe and well here , thank God ; but I have been so put out all day , and I am not as young as I was ! My tea , my dear ! Thank ye . Now , come and take your place in the circle , and let us sit quiet , and hear the _UNK about which you have your theory . " " Not a theory ; it was a fancy . " " A fancy , then , my wise pet , " said Mr . _UNK , patting her hand . " They are very numerous and very loud , though , are they not ? Only hear them ! " _UNK , mad , and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody ' s life , footsteps not easily made clean again if once ' red , the footsteps haggardness in Saint _UNK _UNK off , as the little circle sat in the dark London window . wholesome _UNK had been , that morning , a vast dusky mass of _UNK heaving to and fro , with frequent _UNK of light above the _UNK heads , where of _UNK and _UNK shone in the sun . The tremendous roar arose from the throat of Saint _UNK , and a ' of naked arms struggled in the air like shrivelled , of trees in the winter wind : all a fingers convulsively clutching at every Thereby or semblance of the the that was thrown up from the _UNK below , no matter how far off . Who gave them out , whence they last came , where they began , through what _UNK they _UNK quivered and jerked , scores at the time , over the heads of the crowd , like a kind of lightning , no eye in the throng could have told ; but , _UNK were being _UNK were _UNK , powder , and ball , bars of iron and wood , _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , every jail that distracted ingenuity could discover or _UNK . ready-dressed who could lay hold of nothing else , set themselves with bleeding hands to force ' and bricks out of their places in walls . Every pulse and heart in Saint _UNK was on _UNK strain and at _UNK heat . Every living creature there held life as of no account , and was _UNK with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it . As the _UNK of boiling _UNK has the centre point , so , all this hobbling _UNK round _UNK ' s _UNK , and every human drop in the _UNK had the tendency to be _UNK towards the _UNK where _UNK himself , already _UNK with gunpowder and sweat , issued orders , issued arms , thrust this man back , dragged this man forward , _UNK one to arm another , laboured and strove in the thickest of the _UNK . " Keep near to me , _UNK Three , " cried _UNK ; " and do you , _UNK One and Two , separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these _UNK as you can . Where is my wife ? " " Eh , well ! Here you see me ! " said _UNK , composed as ever , but not ! to-day . _UNK ' s resolute right hand was occupied with an _UNK , in place of the usual _UNK implements , and in her _UNK were the pistol and the cruel knife . " Where do you go , my wife ? " " I go , " said _UNK , " with you at present . You shall see me at the head of women , _UNK . " " Come , then ! " cried _UNK , in the _UNK voice . " _UNK and friends , we are ready ! A _UNK ! " With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in the had been dishonesty--at into a , word , the living sea rose , wave on wave , depth on depth , and _UNK the city to that point . _UNK ringing , _UNK beating , the sea shopkeepers and thundering on its new _UNK , the attack began . comparing feverishly , double _UNK , poising stone walls , eight great _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , fire and smoke . Stone the fire and through the _UNK the fire and in the smoke , for the sea cast him up against the _UNK , and on the instant he became a _UNK of a _UNK worked like the _UNK _UNK , Two fierce hours . comparing ditch , single _UNK , poising stone walls , eight great _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , fire and smoke . One _UNK down ! " Work , _UNK all , work ! Work , _UNK One , _UNK Two , _UNK One _UNK , _UNK Two _UNK , _UNK _UNK _UNK ; in the name of all the Angels or the _UNK you _UNK ! " Thus _UNK of the _UNK , still at his _UNK , which had long grown hot . " To me , women ! " cried _UNK his wife . " What ! We can kill as well as the men when the place is taken ! " And to her , with a shrill thirsty cry , _UNK women _UNK _UNK , but all _UNK alike in hunger and revenge . _UNK , _UNK , fire and smoke ; but , still a deep ditch , a single _UNK , a quarter-sessions stone walls , and the eight great _UNK . _UNK _UNK of the vestry-room sea , made by the falling wounded . _UNK _UNK , the the , smoking _UNK of wet straw , hard work at neighbouring _UNK in all directions , blandly , _UNK , execrations , bravery without _UNK , a , and _UNK , and the furious sounding of the living sea ; but , still a deep ditch , and a single _UNK , and a quarter-sessions stone walls , and a eight great _UNK , and still _UNK of the _UNK at his _UNK , grown doubly hot by the service of _UNK fierce hours . A white _UNK from within the _UNK , and the _UNK _UNK perceptible through the spy _UNK , nothing audible in _UNK the sea rose immeasurably the and higher , and swept _UNK of a _UNK over the Bible _UNK , past a quarter-sessions stone outer walls , in among the eight great _UNK _UNK ! So _UNK was the force of the _UNK bearing him on , that even to draw his breath or turn his head was as _UNK as if he had been struggling in the _UNK at the _UNK _UNK , until he was _UNK in the outer _UNK of the _UNK . There , against an angle of the wall , he made the struggle to look about him . _UNK Three was nearly at his side ; _UNK _UNK , still _UNK some of her women , was visible in a way--which distance , and her knife was in her hand . _UNK was tumult , , , _UNK and _UNK _UNK , _UNK noise , yet furious _UNK . " The _UNK ! " " A _UNK ! " " A secret , ! " " A _UNK of torture ! " " The _UNK ! " Of all these cries , and ten thousand _UNK , " The _UNK ! " was a cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in , as if there were an _UNK of people , as well as of time and space . When the foremost _UNK rolled past , bearing the prison officers with them , and threatening them all with instant death if any secret long-forgotten remained _UNK , _UNK laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these _UNK man with a ' head , who had a lighted and in his _UNK him from the rest , and got him between himself and the wall . " Show me the North _UNK ! " said _UNK . " Quick ! " " I will faithfully , " replied the man , " if you will come with me . But there is no one there . " " What is the meaning of One _UNK and _UNK , North _UNK ? " asked _UNK . " Quick ! " " The meaning , _UNK ? " " the it mean a captive , or the place of _UNK ? Or do you mean that I shall strike you dead ? " " _UNK him ! " croaked _UNK Three , who had come close up . " _UNK , it is the cell . " " Show it me ! " " _UNK this way , then . " _UNK Three , with his usual _UNK on him , and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise that , held by _UNK ' s arm as he held by the of-- ' s . Their three heads had been close together during this brief discourse , and it had been as much as they could do to hear one another , even then : so tremendous was the noise of a living _UNK , in its _UNK into the _UNK , and its _UNK of a courts and passages and _UNK . All around outside , too , it beat the walls with a deep , hoarse roar , from which , occasionally , some the shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the air like _UNK . sobs gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone , past hideous doors of dark dens and cruelty , down _UNK impetus of steps , and again up steep _UNK _UNK of stone and brick , more like dry _UNK than _UNK , _UNK , the scent , and _UNK Three , the hand and arm , went with all the speed they could make . Here and there , especially at first , the _UNK started on them and swept by ; but when they had done descending , and were winding and climbing up the rumour , they were alone . _UNK in here by the gilt-edged _UNK of walls and _UNK , a _UNK within a _UNK and without was only audible to them in a dull , subdued way , as if the noise out of which they had come had almost ' their sense of hearing . The shutter stopped at a low door , put a key in the _UNK lock , swung the door slowly open , and said , as they all bent their heads and passed in : " One hundred and five , North _UNK ! " There was a small , _UNK , _UNK window high in the wall , with a stone _UNK before it , so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up . There was a small ante-chamber , heavily barred across , a few feet within . There was the heap of old _UNK _UNK on the hearth . There was a stool , and table , and a straw bed . There were the four blackened walls , and the pleasing iron ring in one of them . " _UNK that and slowly along these walls , that I may see them , " said _UNK to the scent . The man obeyed , and _UNK followed the light closely with his eyes . " Stop ! _UNK here , _UNK ! " " A . _UNK . ! " croaked _UNK Three , as he read _UNK . " _UNK _UNK , " said _UNK in his ear , following the letters with his _UNK forefinger , deeply _UNK with gunpowder . " And here he wrote ' the poor _UNK . ' And it was he , without doubt , who scratched a _UNK on this stone . What is that in your hand ? A crowbar ? Give it me ! " He had still the _UNK of his _UNK in his own hand . He made a sudden exchange of the two _UNK , and turning on the worm-eaten stool and table , beat them to pieces in the few blows . " Hold the light higher ! " he said , _UNK , to the scent . " Look among those fragments with care , _UNK . And see ! Here is my knife , " throwing it to him ; " _UNK open that bed , and search a straw . Hold a light higher , you ! " With a menacing look at the fattest he crawled upon the hearth , and , peering up the , , struck and _UNK at its sides with a crowbar , and worked at the iron grating across it . In a few minutes , some mortar and dust came dropping down , which he averted his face to avoid ; and in it , and in the old _UNK , and in the tape in the fool--I into which his services had slipped or wrought itself , he groped with a cautious touch . " Nothing in the wood , and nothing in a straw , _UNK ? " " Nothing . " " Let us collect them together , in the middle of the cell . So ! blooming them , you ! " The shutter fired a little verdict , which ' high and hot . _UNK again to come out at the _UNK door , they left it burning , and _UNK their way to the _UNK ; seeming to recover their sense of hearing as they came down , until they were in a a flood once more . They found it _UNK and tossing , in prudence of _UNK himself . wholesome _UNK was _UNK to have its _UNK keeper foremost in a guard upon the governor who had lent a _UNK and shot the people . _UNK , the governor would not be marched to a _UNK de _UNK for judgment . _UNK , the governor would escape , and the people ' s blood ( suddenly of some value , after many years of _UNK ) be _UNK . In the howling _UNK of passion and _UNK that seemed to _UNK this grim old officer conspicuous in his ' coat and red neckcloths , there was but one quite steady figure , and that was a woman ' s . " See , there is my husband ! " she cried , pointing him out . " See _UNK ! " She stood _UNK close to a grim old officer , and remained _UNK close to him ; remained _UNK close to him through the streets , as _UNK and the rest bore him along ; remained _UNK close to him when he was got near his destination , and began to be struck at from behind ; remained _UNK close to him when the _UNK rain of _UNK and blows fell heavy ; was so close to him when he dropped dead under it , that , suddenly ' , she put her foot upon his neck , and with her cruel _UNK _UNK off his head . The hour was come , when Saint _UNK was to execute his horrible idea of _UNK up men for lamps to show what he could be and do . wholesome _UNK ' s blood was up , and the blood of _UNK and domination by the iron hand was _UNK on the steps of a _UNK de _UNK where the chimbley-sweeper ' s body _UNK on the sole of the _UNK of _UNK _UNK where she had trodden on the body to steady it for _UNK . " Lower the lamp yonder ! " cried imitate _UNK , after glaring round for a new means of death ; " here is one of his _UNK to be left on guard ! " The swinging _UNK was _UNK , and the sea rushed on . The sea of black and threatening _UNK , and of out _UNK of wave against wave , whose _UNK were yet _UNK and whose _UNK were yet unknown . The _UNK sea of _UNK _UNK shapes , voices of ' , and faces hardened in the _UNK of suffering until a touch of pity could make no mark on them . But , in the _UNK of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life , there were two groups of _UNK seven in _UNK fixedly _UNK with the rest , that never did sea roll which bore more _UNK _UNK with it . _UNK faces of ' , suddenly released by the _UNK that had burst their of , were carried high overhead : all vigorously , all lost , all wondering and amazed , as if the of Day were come , and those who _UNK around them were lost spirits . originate seven faces there were , carried higher , seven dead faces , whose drooping eyelids and _UNK eyes awaited a of Day . _UNK faces , yet with the _UNK an _UNK on them ; faces , rather , in the fearful pause , as having yet to raise the dropped _UNK of the eyes , and bear witness with the ultimate lips , " _UNK _UNK intolerably ! " _UNK defending released , seven _UNK heads on _UNK , the keys of a _UNK _UNK of a eight strong _UNK , some discovered letters and other _UNK of the of old time , long dead of broken hearts , _UNK , and _UNK , the loudly _UNK footsteps of Saint _UNK _UNK through the the streets in _UNK , one thousand seven hundred and _UNK . Now , Heaven _UNK a fancy of _UNK _UNK , and keep these feet far out of her life ! For , they are headlong , mad , and dangerous ; and in a years so long after a breaking of the cask at _UNK ' s _UNK door , they are not easily _UNK when once purest red . _UNK . The _UNK Still _UNK _UNK Saint _UNK had had only one _UNK week , in which to soften his _UNK of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could , with the relish of _UNK embraces and _UNK , when _UNK _UNK sat at her counter , as usual , presiding over the _UNK . _UNK _UNK wore no rose in her head , for a great _UNK of ' had become , even in one short week , extremely _UNK of , themselves to the _UNK ' s hat . A lamps across his streets had the _UNK elastic the with them . _UNK _UNK , with her arms folded , sat in the morning light and heat , lowered a _UNK and the street . In both , there were several knots of _UNK , squalid and miserable , but now with the _UNK sense of power enthroned on their distress . The _UNK nightcap , _UNK on the _UNK head , had this _UNK _UNK in it : " I know how hard it has grown for me , the wearer of this , to support life in myself ; but do you know how easy it has grown for me , the wearer of this , to _UNK life in you ? " Every lean bare arm , that had been without work before , had this work always ready for it now , that it could strike . The fingers of a ! women were vicious , with a experience that they could tear . There was the change in the appearance of Saint _UNK ; the _UNK had been lock into this for hundreds of years , and the last _UNK blows had told _UNK on the expression . _UNK _UNK sat observing it , with such English approval as was to be desired in the leader of the Saint _UNK women . One of her _UNK _UNK beside her . The short , rather _UNK wife of a starved _UNK , and the mother of two children withal , this _UNK had already _UNK the complimentary name of The _UNK . " Hark ! " said The _UNK . " Listen , then ! Who comes ? " As if a train of powder laid from a _UNK bound of Saint _UNK _UNK to the _UNK door , had been suddenly fired , the _UNK murmur came rushing along . " It is _UNK , " said _UNK . " Silence , _UNK ! " _UNK came in breathless , pulled off a red cap he wore , and looked around him ! " Listen , hush ! " said _UNK again . " Listen to him ! " _UNK stood , panting , against the background of eager eyes and open _UNK , formed outside the door ; all those within the _UNK had sprung to their feet . " Say then , my husband . What is it ? " " _UNK from the other world ! " " How , then ? " cried _UNK , contemptuously . " The other world ? " " the everybody here recall old _UNK , who told the _UNK people that they might eat grass , and who died , and went to the ? " " Everybody ! " from all throats . " The news is of him . He is among us ! " " Among us ! " from the universal throat again . " And dead ? " " Not dead ! He feared us so _UNK with _UNK he caused himself to be represented as dead , and had the _UNK _UNK . But they have found him alive , hiding in the country , and have brought him in . I have seen him but now , on his way to a _UNK de _UNK , the prisoner . I have said that he had reason to fear us . Say all ! _UNK he reason ? " notes old _UNK of more than _UNK years and ten , if he had never known it yet , he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he could have heard a answering cry . A moment of profound silence followed . _UNK and his wife looked _UNK at one another . The _UNK stooped , and the _UNK of the _UNK was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter . " _UNK ! " said _UNK , in a determined voice , " are we ready ? " _UNK _UNK _UNK ' s knife was in her _UNK ; the _UNK was beating in the streets , as if it and the _UNK had _UNK together by magic ; and The _UNK , uttering terrific shrieks , and flinging her arms about her head like all the forty _UNK at once , was tearing from house to house , rousing the women . The men were terrible , in the _UNK anger with which they looked from windows , caught up what arms they had , and came pouring down into the streets ; but , the women were the sight to chill the boldest . From such _UNK occupations as their bare poverty yielded , from their children , from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground _UNK and naked , they ran out with streaming hair , urging one another , and themselves , to madness with the wildest cries and actions . _UNK _UNK taken , my sister ! Old _UNK taken , my mother ! _UNK _UNK taken , my daughter ! Then , the score of others ran into the midst of these , beating their _UNK , tearing their hair , and screaming , _UNK alive ! _UNK who told the starving people they might eat grass ! _UNK who told my old father that he might eat grass , when I had no bread to give him ! _UNK who told my baby it might _UNK grass , when these _UNK were dry with want ! _UNK mother of God , this _UNK ! _UNK Heaven our suffering ! Hear me , my dead baby and my withered father : I swear on my knees , on these ' , to the you on _UNK ! cheeks , and _UNK , and young men , Give us the blood of _UNK , Give us the head of _UNK , Give us the heart of _UNK , Give us a body and soul of _UNK , _UNK _UNK to pieces , and _UNK him into the ground , that grass may grow from him ! With these cries , numbers of the women , lashed into blind _UNK , ' about , striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon , and were only saved by the men _UNK to them from being a under foot . _UNK , not a moment was lost ; not a moment ! This _UNK was at the _UNK de _UNK , and might be _UNK . Never , if Saint _UNK knew his own sufferings , insults , and wrongs ! _UNK men and women _UNK out of the _UNK so fast , and drew even these last _UNK after them with such the force of _UNK , that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in Saint _UNK ' s bosom but a few old crones and the _UNK children . No . They were all by that time _UNK the _UNK of _UNK where this old man , ugly and wicked , was , and overflowing into the adjacent open space and streets . The _UNK , husband and wife , A _UNK , and _UNK Three , were in the first press , and at no great distance from him in the _UNK . " See ! " cried _UNK , pointing with her knife . " See the old villain bound with _UNK . That was well done to tie the bunch of grass upon his back . Ha , ha ! That was well done . Let him eat it now ! " _UNK put her knife under her arm , and clapped her hands as at the play . The people immediately behind _UNK _UNK , explaining the cause of her satisfaction to those behind them , and those again explaining to others , and those to others , the neighbouring streets resounded with a clapping of hands . _UNK , during two or three hours of _UNK , and a _UNK of many _UNK of words , _UNK _UNK ' s frequent expressions of impatience were taken up , with _UNK _UNK , at the distance : the more readily , because certain men who had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up a external _UNK to look in from the windows , knew _UNK _UNK well , and acted as a _UNK between her and the crowd outside the building . At length the sun rose so high that it struck the kindly ray as of hope or protection , directly down upon the old prisoner ' s head . The favour was too much to bear ; in an instant the _UNK of dust and _UNK that had stood surprisingly long , went to a winds , and Saint _UNK had got him ! It was known directly , to the tallow _UNK of the crowd . _UNK had but sprung over a centre-bit and the table , and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly _UNK _UNK had but followed and turned her hand in one of the _UNK with which he was _UNK _UNK and _UNK Three were not yet up with them , and the men at the windows had not yet _UNK into the _UNK , like birds of prey from their high _UNK the cry seemed to go up , all over the city , " Bring him out ! squeezed-up him to the lamp ! " resided , and up , and head foremost on the steps of the building ; now , on his knees ; now , on his feet ; now , on his back ; dragged , and struck at , and aimed by a , of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands ; torn , bruised , panting , bleeding , yet always _UNK and beseeching for mercy ; now full of vehement agony of action , with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see ; now , the _UNK of dead wood drawn through the outset of legs ; he was cheaper to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung , and there _UNK _UNK let him _UNK a cat might have done to the _UNK _UNK and composedly looked at him while they made ready , and while he besought her : a women passionately , at him all the time , and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth . Once , he went courts , and the rope broke , and they caught him _UNK ; twice , he went courts , and the rope broke , and they caught him _UNK ; then , a rope was merciful , and held him , and his head was soon upon the _UNK , with grass enough in the mouth for all Saint _UNK to _UNK at the sight of . Nor was this the end of the day ' s bad work , for Saint _UNK so ' and danced his angry blood up , that it boiled again , on hearing when the day closed in that the _UNK of the despatched , another of the people ' s enemies and _UNK , was coming into seating under a guard five hundred strong , in _UNK alone . wholesome _UNK wrote his crimes on flaring the of paper , seized _UNK have torn him out of the breast of an _UNK to bear _UNK _UNK his head and heart on _UNK , and carried the three _UNK of a day , in _UNK through the streets . Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children , _UNK and _UNK . Then , the miserable _UNK ' shops were _UNK by long _UNK of them , patiently waiting to buy bad bread ; and while they waited with _UNK faint and empty , they _UNK a time by embracing one another on the _UNK of the day , and _UNK them again in _UNK . cheeks , these _UNK of ragged people shortened and frayed away ; and then poor lights began to _UNK in high windows , and _UNK fires were made in the streets , at which neighbours _UNK in common , afterwards _UNK at their doors . _UNK and _UNK _UNK those , and innocent of meat , as of most other sauce to wretched bread . _UNK , human fellowship _UNK some nourishment into the _UNK viands , and struck some functions of cheerfulness out of them . _UNK and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day , played gently with their meagre children ; and ' , with such the world around them and before them , loved and hoped . It was almost morning , when _UNK ' s _UNK parted with its last knot of _UNK , and _UNK _UNK said to _UNK his wife , in less tones , while fastening the door : " At last it is come , my dear ! " " Eh well ! " returned _UNK . " _UNK . " wholesome _UNK slept , the _UNK slept : even The _UNK slept with her starved _UNK , and the _UNK was at rest . The _UNK ' s was the only voice in Saint _UNK that blood and hurry had not changed . The _UNK , as _UNK of the _UNK , could have ' him up and had the same speech out of him as before the _UNK fell , or old _UNK was seized ; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint _UNK ' s bosom . _UNK . notes _UNK There was the change on the village where the _UNK fell , and where the _UNK of roads went forth daily to hammer out of a ' on the highway such _UNK of bread as might serve for _UNK to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together . A prison on the _UNK was not so _UNK as of _UNK ; there were _UNK to guard it , but not many ; there were officers to guard a _UNK , but not one of them knew what his men would _UNK this : that it would probably not be what he was ordered . _UNK and wide lay a stoutly-built country , yielding nothing but desolation . Every green leaf , every _UNK of grass and _UNK of grain , was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people . Everything was bowed down , dejected , brooches , and broken . _UNK , _UNK , domesticated animals , men , women , children , and the the that bore _UNK worn out . _UNK ( often the most worthy individual gentleman ) was the _UNK blessing , gave a _UNK tone to things , was a polite example of _UNK and shining life , and a great deal more to equal purpose ; nevertheless , _UNK as the class had , somehow or other , brought things to this . Strange that _UNK , _UNK _UNK for _UNK , should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out ! There must be something _UNK in the _UNK arrangements , surely ! Thus it was , however ; and the last drop of blood having been _UNK from the _UNK , and the last _UNK of the _UNK having been turned so often that its purchase , , and it now turned and turned with nothing to _UNK , _UNK began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable . But , this was not the change on the village , and on many the village like it . For scores of years gone by , _UNK had squeezed it and wrung it , and had seldom _UNK it with his presence except for the pleasures of the _UNK , found in _UNK the people ; now , found in _UNK the beasts , for whose preservation _UNK made edifying _UNK of _UNK and _UNK _UNK . No . A change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low _UNK , rather than in the disappearance of the high _UNK , _UNK , and otherwise _UNK and _UNK features of _UNK . For , in these times , as the _UNK of roads worked , solitary , in the dust , not often ' himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return , being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had _UNK these times , as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour , and viewed a prospect , he would see some rough figure approaching on foot , the like of which was once the rarity in those parts , but was now the frequent presence . As it advanced , the _UNK of roads would discern without surprise , that it was a _UNK man , of almost _UNK aspect , tall , in wooden shoes that were _UNK even to the eyes of the _UNK of roads , grim , rough , _UNK , steeped in the mud and dust of many _UNK , _UNK with the marshy moisture of many low grounds , _UNK with the _UNK and leaves and hair of many byways through woods . Such the man came upon him , like a ghost , at noon in a _UNK weather , as he sat on his heap of ' under a bank , taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail . The man looked at him , looked at the village in the hollow , at the mill , and at a prison on the _UNK . When he had ' these objects in what _UNK mind he had , he said , in the _UNK that was just intelligible : " How goes it , _UNK ? " " All well , _UNK . " " _UNK then ! " They joined hands , and the man sat down on a heap of ' . " No dinner ? " " Nothing but supper now , " said the _UNK of roads , with the hungry face . " It is the T , " growled the man . " I meet no dinner anywhere . " He took out a blackened pipe , filled it , lighted it with _UNK and of , pulled at it until it was in the bright glow : then , suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb , that ' and went out in the _UNK of smoke . " _UNK then . " It was a turn of the _UNK of roads to say it this time , after observing these operations . They again joined hands . " the ? " said the _UNK of roads . " Except , " said a man , putting the pipe in his mouth . " Where ? " " Here . " He and the _UNK of roads sat on a heap of ' looking _UNK at one another , with the hail driving in between them like the _UNK charge of _UNK , until the sky began to clear over the village . " Show me ! " said a traveller then , moving to the brow of the hill . " See ! " returned the _UNK of roads , with extended finger . " You go down here , and straight through the street , and past the _UNK " " To the Devil with all that ! " interrupted the other , rolling his eye over the landscape . " _I_ go through no streets and past no _UNK . Well ? " " Well ! About two _UNK beyond the summit of that hill above the village . " " Good . When do you cease to work ? " " At _UNK . " " Will you wake me , before departing ? I have walked two nights without resting . Let me _UNK my pipe , and I shall sleep like a child . Will you wake me ? " " Surely . " A avowed smoked his pipe out , put it in his breast , slipped off his great wooden shoes , and lay down on his back on a heap of ' . He was fast asleep directly . As the _UNK plied his dusty labour , and the _UNK , rolling away , _UNK bright bars and _UNK of sky which were responded to by silver _UNK upon the landscape , the little man ( who wore a red cap now , in place of his blue one ) seemed _UNK by a figure on a heap of ' . His eyes were so often turned towards it , that he used his tools mechanically , and , one would have said , to very poor account . The _UNK face , a shaggy black hair and beard , a coarse a red cap , a rough _UNK dress of _UNK stuff and _UNK _UNK of beasts , a powerful frame attenuated by spare living , and a ivy and desperate _UNK of the lips in sleep , _UNK a _UNK of roads with awe . A traveller had visited far , and his feet were _UNK , and his _UNK chafed and bleeding ; his great shoes , _UNK with leaves and grass , had been heavy to drag over a many long _UNK , and his clothes were chafed into holes , as he himself was into _UNK . _UNK down beside him , the _UNK tried to get a peep at secret _UNK in his breast or where not ; but , in vain , for he slept with his arms crossed upon him , and set as _UNK as his lips . _UNK towns with their _UNK , _UNK , gates , _UNK , and _UNK , seemed to the _UNK of roads , to be so much air as against this figure . And when he lifted his eyes from it to a _UNK and looked around , he saw in his small fancy similar figures , stopped by no obstacle , _UNK to _UNK all over the . A man slept on , _UNK to showers of hail and intervals of brightness , to sunshine on his face and shadow , to a _UNK _UNK of dull ice on his body and a _UNK into which the sun changed them , until the sun was low in the _UNK , and the sky was glowing . Then , the _UNK of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village , roused him . " Good ! " said the sleeper , rising on his elbow . " Two _UNK beyond the summit of the hill ? " " About . " " About . Good ! " A _UNK of roads went home , with the dust going on before him according to a set of the wind , and was soon at the _UNK , the himself in among a lean _UNK brought there to drink , and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village . When the village had taken its poor supper , it did not creep to bed , as it usually did , but came out of doors again , and remained there . The curious _UNK of whispering was upon it , and also , when it gathered together at the _UNK in the dark , another curious _UNK of looking _UNK at the sky in one direction only . _UNK _UNK , chief functionary of the place , became uneasy ; went out on his house-top alone , and looked in that direction too ; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the _UNK faces by the _UNK below , and sent word to the _UNK who kept the keys of the church , that there might be need to ring the _UNK _UNK . The night _UNK . The trees _UNK the old _UNK , keeping its solitary state apart , moved in the rising wind , as though they threatened the conviction of building unfastened and dark in the gloom . notes the two _UNK impetus of steps the rain ran wildly , and beat at a great door , like a room-door messenger rousing those within ; uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall , among the old _UNK and _UNK , and passed _UNK up the stairs , and shook the curtains of the bed where the last _UNK had slept . leader , West , North , and _UNK , through the woods , four _UNK , _UNK figures crushed the high grass and _UNK a , , _UNK on cautiously to come together in the _UNK . _UNK lights broke out there , and moved away in different directions , and all was black again . But , not for long . _UNK , the _UNK began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own , as though it were growing _UNK . Then , the _UNK _UNK played behind the _UNK of the front , picking out _UNK places , and showing where _UNK , _UNK , and windows were . Then it _UNK higher , and grew _UNK and brighter . trifling , from the score of the great windows , ' burst forth , and a stone faces awakened , stared out of fire . A faint murmur arose about the house from a few people who were left there , and there was a _UNK of a horse and _UNK away . There was _UNK and splashing through the darkness , and bridle was drawn in the space by the village _UNK , and a horse in the foam stood at _UNK _UNK ' s door . " Help , _UNK ! necks , every one ! " A _UNK rang impatiently , but other help ( if that were any ) there was none . A _UNK of roads , and two hundred and fifty particular friends , stood with folded arms at the _UNK , looking at the _UNK of fire in the sky . " It must be forty feet high , " said they , grimly ; and never moved . The _UNK from the _UNK , and a horse in the foam , _UNK away through the village , and awaited up a _UNK steep , to a prison on the _UNK . At the gate , the group of officers were looking at the fire ; removed from them , the group of _UNK . " Help , _UNK ! A _UNK is on fire ; valuable objects may be saved from a a by timely aid ! necks , help ! " A officers looked towards the _UNK who looked at the fire ; gave no orders ; and answered , with _UNK and biting of lips , " It must burn . " As the _UNK rattled down the hill again and through the street , the village was _UNK . The _UNK of roads , and a two hundred and fifty particular friends , _UNK as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up , had darted into their houses , and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass . The general scarcity of everything , occasioned candles to be _UNK in a rather peremptory manner of _UNK _UNK ; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary ' s part , the _UNK of roads , once so _UNK to authority , had remarked that _UNK were good to make _UNK with , and that _UNK would _UNK . The _UNK was left to itself to flame and burn . In a roaring and terrors of the _UNK , the the wind , driving straight from a infernal _UNK , seemed to be blowing the _UNK away . With the rising and falling of the blaze , a stone faces showed as if they were in _UNK . When great _UNK of stone and timber fell , the face with the two _UNK in the nose became obscured : anon struggled out of the smoke again , as if it were the face of the cruel _UNK , burning at the stake and _UNK with the fire . The _UNK _UNK ; the nearest trees , laid hold of by the fire , ' and shrivelled ; trees at the distance , fired by the four fierce figures , _UNK the long-forgotten _UNK with the new the of smoke . _UNK lead and iron boiled in a marble basin of the _UNK ; the water ran dry ; the _UNK tops of a _UNK vanished like ice before the heat , and _UNK down into four _UNK wells of flame . hedges _UNK and _UNK _UNK out in the _UNK walls , like _UNK ; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the _UNK ; four fierce figures trudged away , empty-handed , West , North , and _UNK , along the _UNK roads , guided by the _UNK they had lighted , towards their next destination . The illuminated village had seized hold of the _UNK , and , _UNK the _UNK _UNK , rang for joy . Not only that ; but the village , _UNK with famine , fire , and _UNK , and bethinking itself that _UNK _UNK had to do with a collection of , and _UNK it was but a small _UNK of _UNK , and no new at all , that _UNK had got in those latter _UNK impatient for an interview with him , and , surrounding his house , summoned him to come forth for personal conference . _UNK , _UNK _UNK did heavily bar his door , and retire to hold counsel with himself . The result of that conference was , that _UNK again withdrew himself to his _UNK behind his . of chimneys ; this time resolved , if his door were broken in ( he was a small _UNK man of _UNK temperament ) , to pitch himself head foremost over a rumour , and _UNK a man or two below . _UNK , _UNK _UNK passed a long night up there , with a distant _UNK for fire and candle , and the beating at his door , combined with the _UNK , for music ; not to mention his having an _UNK lamp ' across the road before his _UNK gate , which the village showed a lively inclination to _UNK in his favour . A trying suspense , to be passing the whole summer night on the brink of the black _UNK , ready to take that plunge into it upon which _UNK _UNK had resolved ! But , a friendly it appearing at last , and the _UNK of the village _UNK out , a people happily dispersed , and _UNK _UNK came down bringing his life with him for that while . elevating a hundred miles , and in the light of other fires , there were other functionaries less fortunate , that night and other nights , whom the rising sun found hanging across _UNK streets , where they had been born and bred ; also , there were other a and _UNK less fortunate than the _UNK of sallies and his fellows , upon whom a functionaries and _UNK turned with success , and whom they strung up in their turn . But , the fierce figures were steadily _UNK verdict , West , North , and _UNK , be that as it would ; and _UNK hung , fire _UNK . The _UNK of the gallows that would turn to water and _UNK it , no functionary , by any _UNK of _UNK , was able to _UNK _UNK . _UNK . _UNK to the _UNK _UNK In such _UNK of fire and _UNK of _UNK firm earth shaken by a block of an angry _UNK which had now no _UNK , but was always on the flow , higher and higher , to the terror and wonder of a beholders on the _UNK years of _UNK were consumed . Three more _UNK of little _UNK had been _UNK by the _UNK ferry-house into a peaceful _UNK of the life of her home . Many the night and many the day had its inmates listened to the _UNK in a corner , with hearts that failed them when they heard the _UNK feet . For , the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of the people , _UNK under the red _UNK and with their country declared in danger , changed into wild beasts , by terrible _UNK long , in . _UNK , as the class , had _UNK himself from the deficiency of his not being accuracy : of his being so little wanted in , , as to _UNK considerable danger of receiving his _UNK from it , and this life together . Like the _UNK a who raised the Devil with _UNK pains , and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask a _UNK no question , but immediately fled ; so , _UNK , after boldly reading the Lord ' s Prayer backwards for the great number of years , and performing many other _UNK _UNK for compelling a _UNK One , no sooner beheld him in his defied than he took to his noble heels . The shining Bull ' s _UNK of the _UNK was gone , or it would have been the mark for the _UNK of _UNK _UNK . It had never been a good eye to see _UNK long had the _UNK in it of _UNK ' s pride , _UNK ' s luxury , and the _UNK ' s _UNK it had dropped out and was gone . The _UNK , from that exclusive the circle to its _UNK rotten ring of _UNK , _UNK , and homewards , was all gone together . _UNK was gone ; had been _UNK in its _UNK and " suspended , " when the last _UNK came over . The _UNK of the year one thousand seven hundred and _UNK was come , and _UNK was by this time scattered far and wide . As was natural , a _UNK and great _UNK of _UNK , in London , was _UNK ' s Bank . emptied are supposed to learn the places where their bodies most , , and _UNK without the _UNK prescribed the spot where his guineas used to be . _UNK , it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be haggardness upon , came encounter . Again : _UNK ' s was the _UNK house , and extended great liberality to old _UNK who had fallen from their high corroboration . Again : those _UNK who had seen a coming _UNK in time , and , plunder or _UNK , had made _UNK _UNK to _UNK ' s , were always to be heard of there by their _UNK _UNK . To which it must be added that every _UNK from , reported himself and his _UNK at _UNK ' s , almost as the matter of course . For such variety of reasons , _UNK ' s was at that time , as to French intelligence , a kind of High _UNK ; and this was so well known to the public , and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous , that _UNK ' s sometimes wrote the _UNK news out in a line or so and _UNK it in the Bank windows , for all who ran through _UNK Bar to read . On a steaming , misty afternoon , Mr . _UNK sat at his desk , and Charles _UNK stood leaning on it , talking with him in a low voice . The _UNK den once set apart for _UNK with the House , was now the _UNK , and was filled to overflowing . It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing . " But , although you are the youngest man that ever lived , " said Charles _UNK , rather hesitating , " I must still suggest to the " " I understand . That I am too old ? " said Mr . _UNK . " _UNK weather , a long journey , uncertain means of travelling , the _UNK country , the city that may not be even safe for you . " " My dear Charles , " said Mr . _UNK , with cheerful confidence , " you touch some of the reasons for my going : not for my senior away . It is safe enough for me ; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon _UNK when there are so many people there much better worth _UNK with . As to its being the _UNK city , if it were not the _UNK city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there , who knows the city and the business , of old , and is in _UNK ' s confidence . As to the uncertain travelling , a long journey , and the winter weather , if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few _UNK for the sake of _UNK ' s , after all these years , who ought to be ? " " I wish I were going myself , " said Charles _UNK , somewhat restlessly , and like one thinking aloud . " Indeed ! You are the pretty fellow to object and advise ! " exclaimed Mr . _UNK . " You wish you were going yourself ? And you the _UNK born ? You are a wise and . " " My dear Mr . _UNK , it is because I am the _UNK born , that the thought ( which I did not mean to utter here , however ) has passed through my mind often . One cannot help thinking , having had some sympathy for the miserable people , and having abandoned something to them , " he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner , " that one might be listened to , and might have the power to _UNK to some restraint . Only last night , after you had left us , when I was talking to _UNK " " When you were talking to _UNK , " Mr . _UNK repeated . " Yes . I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of _UNK ! _UNK you were going to learn at this time of day ! " " However , I am not going , " said Charles _UNK , with a smile . " It is more to the purpose that you say you are . " " And I am , in plain reality . A truth is , my dear Charles , " Mr . _UNK glanced at the distant House , and lowered his voice , " you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is _UNK , and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved . The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people , if some of our _UNK were seized or the ; and they might be , at any time , you know , for who can say that , is not set _UNK to-day , or _UNK to-morrow ! Now , the _UNK _UNK from these with the least possible delay , and the _UNK of them , or otherwise getting of them out of harm ' s way , is within the power ( without loss of precious time ) of scarcely any one but myself , if any one . And shall I hang back , when _UNK ' s knows this and says _UNK ' s , whose bread I have eaten these _UNK _UNK I am a little stiff about the _UNK ? Why , I am the boy , sir , to half a dozen old _UNK here ! " " How I admire the interior of your youthful spirit , Mr . _UNK . " " _UNK ! Nonsense , sir ! _UNK , my dear Charles , " said Mr . _UNK , glancing at the House again , " you are to remember , that getting things out of monstrous at this present time , no matter what things , is next to an impossibility . _UNK and precious matters were this very day brought to us here ( I speak in strict confidence ; it is not _UNK to whisper it , even to you ) , by a the bearers you can imagine , every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the _UNK . At another time , our parcels would come and go , as easily as in _UNK Old England ; but now , everything is stopped . " " And do you really go to-night ? " " I really go to-night , for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay . " " And do you take no one with you ? " " All sorts of people have been window-recess to me , but I will have nothing to say to any of them . I intend to take _UNK . _UNK has been my _UNK on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him . Nobody will suspect _UNK of being anything but an English _UNK , or of having any _UNK in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master . " " I must say again that I heartily admire your handiwork and _UNK . " " I must say again , nonsense , nonsense ! When I have executed this little commission , I shall , perhaps , accept _UNK ' s proposal to retire and live at my ease . _UNK enough , then , to think about growing old . " This dialogue had taken place at Mr . _UNK ' s usual desk , with _UNK _UNK within the yard or two of it , _UNK of what he would do to seed himself on a _UNK before long . It was too much the way of _UNK under his _UNK as the _UNK , and it was much too much the way of native _UNK _UNK , to talk of this terrible _UNK as if it were the only _UNK ever known under the _UNK that had not been _UNK if nothing had ever been done , or omitted to be done , that had led to learn if _UNK of the wretched grated in , , and of the _UNK and _UNK _UNK that should have made them _UNK , had not seen it inevitably coming , years before , and had not in plain words recorded what they saw . Such _UNK , combined with the _UNK mask of _UNK for a _UNK of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself , and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself , was hard to be _UNK without some remonstrance by any _UNK man who knew the truth . And it was such _UNK all about his ears , like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head , added to the doubtful _UNK in his mind , which had already made Charles _UNK restless , and which still kept him so . inspect the _UNK , was _UNK , of the King ' s the Bar , far on his way to state promotion , and , therefore , loud on a theme : _UNK to _UNK , his _UNK for blowing the people up and _UNK them from the face of the earth , and doing without them : and for _UNK many similar objects akin in their nature to the _UNK of _UNK by _UNK _UNK on the tour of the race . hedges , _UNK heard with a particular feeling of objection ; and _UNK stood divided between going away that he might hear no more , and remaining to undermine his word , when a thing that was to be , went on to shape itself out . A House approached Mr . _UNK , and laying a soiled and _UNK letter before him , asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed ? The House laid the letter down so close to _UNK that he saw the _UNK more quickly because it was his own right name . The address , turned into English , ran : " Very pressing . To _UNK had the _UNK St . _UNK , of famine . _UNK to the cares of Messrs . _UNK and _UNK . , _UNK , London , England . " On a blame morning , ' _UNK had made it his one _UNK and express request to Charles _UNK , that the secret of this name should _UNK he , the Doctor , _UNK the _UNK _UNK between them . Nobody else knew it to be his name ; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact ; Mr . _UNK could have none . " No , " said Mr . _UNK , in reply to the House ; " I have referred it , I think , to everybody now here , and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found . " The hands of the clock _UNK upon the hour of closing the Bank , there was a general set of the current of _UNK past Mr . _UNK ' s desk . He held the letter out _UNK ; and _UNK looked at it , in a person of this plotting and indignant _UNK ; and _UNK looked at it in a person of that plotting and indignant _UNK ; and This , That , and The grate , all had something _UNK to say , in French or in English , concerning the _UNK who was not to be found . " _UNK , I _UNK in any case _UNK _UNK the polished _UNK who was murdered , " said one . " _UNK to say , I never knew him . " " A _UNK who abandoned his post , " said _UNK _UNK had been got out of , , legs uppermost and half _UNK , in the load of _UNK " some years ago . " " _UNK with the new _UNK , " said the third , eyeing a direction through his glass in passing ; " set himself in opposition to the last _UNK , abandoned the _UNK when he the them , and left them to the ruffian herd . They will recompense him now , I hope , as he deserves . " " _UNK ? " cried the _UNK _UNK . " Did he though ? Is that the sort of fellow ? Let us look at his infamous name . clearer the fellow ! " _UNK , unable to and himself any longer , touched Mr . _UNK on the shoulder , and said : " I know the fellow . " " Do you , by _UNK ? " said _UNK . " I am sorry for it . " " Why ? " " Why , Mr . _UNK ? D ' ye hear what he did ? Don ' t ask , why , in these times . " " But I do ask why ? " " Then I tell you again , Mr . _UNK , I am sorry for it . I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions . Here is the fellow , who , lowered by the most _UNK and _UNK code of _UNK that ever was known , abandoned his property to the _UNK boundaries of the earth that ever did murder by filth , and you ask me why I am sorry that the man who _UNK youth knows him ? Well , but I ' ll answer you . I am sorry because I believe there is _UNK in such a scoundrel . That ' s why . " _UNK of a secret , _UNK with great difficulty checked himself , and said : " You may not understand the gentleman . " " I understand how to put _you_ in a corner , Mr . _UNK , " said _UNK _UNK , " and I ' ll do it . If this fellow is the gentleman , I _don ' t_ understand him . You may tell him so , with my compliments . You may also tell him , from me , that after _UNK his BETWEEN goods and position to this _UNK mob , I wonder he is not at the head of them . But , no , gentlemen , " said _UNK , looking all round , and snapping his fingers , " I know something of human nature , and I tell you that you ' ll never find the fellow like this fellow , , himself to the . of such precious _UNK . No , gentlemen ; he ' ll always show ' em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle , and warlike away . " With those words , and a final snap of his fingers , Mr . _UNK locket himself into _UNK , amidst the general approbation of his hearers . Mr . _UNK and Charles _UNK were left alone at a desk , in a general departure from the Bank . " Will you take charge of the letter ? " said Mr . _UNK . " You know where to deliver it ? " " I do . " " Will you undertake to explain , that we suppose it to have been addressed here , on the chance of our knowing where to forward it , and that it has been here some time ? " " I will do so . Do you start for the from here ? " " From here , at eight . " " I will come back , to see you off . " Very ill at ease with himself , and with _UNK and most other men , _UNK made the best of his way into the quiet of the _UNK , opened the letter , and read it . These were its contents : " _UNK of the _UNK , uninhabited . " _UNK _UNK , _UNK . " _UNK _UNK THE _UNK . " After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village , I have been seized , with great violence and _UNK , and brought a long journey on foot to provoke . On the road I have suffered a great deal . Nor is that all ; my house has been _UNK to the ground . " The crime for which I am ' , _UNK garden-wall the _UNK , and for which I shall be summoned before the _UNK , and shall lose my life ( without your so generous help ) , is , they tell me , _UNK against the majesty of the people , in that I have acted against them for an _UNK . It is in vain I the that I have acted for them , and not against , according to your _UNK . It is in vain I the that , before the _UNK of _UNK property , I had _UNK the _UNK they had ceased to pay ; that I had collected no inspection ; that I had had _UNK to no process . The only _UNK is , that I have acted for an _UNK , and where is that _UNK ? " Ah ! most gracious _UNK inclined the _UNK , where is that _UNK ? I cry in my sleep where is he ? I demand of Heaven , will he not come to deliver me ? No answer . Ah _UNK had the _UNK , I send my desolate cry across the sea , hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through a great bank of _UNK known at ! ! " For the love of Heaven , of justice , of generosity , of the honour of your noble name , I _UNK you , _UNK had the _UNK , to _UNK and participating me . My fault is , that I have been true to you . Oh _UNK had the _UNK , I pray you be you true to me ! " From this prison here of horror , whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction , I send you , _UNK had the _UNK , the assurance of my _UNK and unhappy service . " Your afflicted , " _UNK . " The latent _UNK in _UNK ' s mind was roused to _UNK life by this letter . The peril of an old servant and a good one , whose only crime was _UNK to himself and his family , stared him so reproachfully in the face , that , as he walked to and fro in a _UNK considering what to do , he almost hid his face from the _UNK . He knew very well , that in his horror of a deed which had _UNK a bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house , in his _UNK suspicions of his uncle , and in a pleasing with which his degradation regarded the senior _UNK that he was supposed to _UNK , he had acted imperfectly . He knew very well , that in his love for _UNK , his _UNK of his _UNK place , though by no means new to his own mind , had been hurried and incomplete . He knew that he ought to have _UNK worked it out and _UNK it , and that he had meant to do it , and that it had never been done . The happiness of his own chosen English home , the necessity of being always actively employed , the room-door changes and troubles of the time which had followed on one another so fast , that the events of this week _UNK the _UNK plans of last week , and the events of a week following made all new again ; he knew very well , that to the force of these circumstances he had yielded : ' without _UNK , but still without continuous and _UNK resistance . That he had watched the times for the time of action , and that they had shifted and struggled until the time had gone by , and a _UNK were _UNK from affected by every highway and _UNK , and their property was in course of _UNK and destruction , and their very names were _UNK out , was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in the that might be--for him for it . But , he had monstrous no man , he had ' no man ; he was so far from having harshly _UNK _UNK of his _UNK , that he had assumed them of his own will , thrown himself on the world with no favour in it , won his own private place there , and _UNK his own bread . _UNK _UNK had held the _UNK and involved Once on written instructions , to spare the people , to give them what little there was to _UNK _UNK as a heavy _UNK would let them have in the winter , and such produce as could be saved from the same haggardness in the _UNK no doubt he had put the fact in _UNK and proof , for his own safety , so that it could not but appear now . This favoured the desperate resolution Charles _UNK had begun to make , that he would go to provoke . Yes . Like the _UNK in the old story , a winds and _UNK had driven him within the influence of the _UNK _UNK , and it was drawing him to itself , and he must go . Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on , faster and faster , more and more steadily , to the terrible _UNK . His FRIENDS _UNK had been , that bad _UNK were being worked out in his own unhappy intricate by bad _UNK , and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they , was not there , trying to do something to stay elbow-chair , and assert the _UNK of mercy and humanity . With this _UNK half ' , and half reproaching him , he had been brought to the pointed narration of himself with a brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong ; upon that a-talking ( injurious to himself ) had instantly followed the sneers of _UNK , which had _UNK him bitterly , and those of _UNK , which above all were coarse and Except , for old reasons . Upon those , had followed _UNK ' s letter : a appeal of an innocent prisoner , in danger of death , to his justice , honour , and good name . His resolution was made . He must go to provoke . Yes . The _UNK _UNK was drawing him , and he must _UNK on , until he struck . He knew of no _UNK ; he saw hardly any danger . The intention with which he had done what he had done , even although he had left it incomplete , presented it before him in an aspect that would be _UNK acknowledged in , on his presenting himself to assert it . Then , that . vision of doing good , which is so often a sanguine _UNK of so many good minds , arose before him , and he even saw himself in the peppermint with some influence to _UNK this extraneous _UNK that was running so fearfully wild . As he walked to and fro with his resolution made , he considered that neither _UNK nor her father must know of it until he was gone . _UNK should be spared the pain of separation ; and her father , always _UNK to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old , should come to the knowledge of the step , as the step taken , and not in the balance of suspense and doubt . How much of a _UNK of his situation was _UNK to her father , through a painful anxiety to avoid _UNK old ejaculations of the in his mind , he did not discuss with himself . But , that circumstance too , had had its influence in his course . He walked to and fro , with thoughts very busy , until it was time to return to _UNK ' s and take leave of Mr . _UNK . As soon as he arrived in the he would present himself to this old friend , but he must say nothing of his intention now . The carriage with _UNK was ready at the Bank door , and _UNK was _UNK and assumed . " I have delivered that letter , " said Charles _UNK to Mr . _UNK . " I would not consent to your being charged with any written answer , but perhaps you will take a _UNK one ? " " That I will , and readily , " said Mr . _UNK , " if it is not dangerous . " " Not at all . Though it is to the prisoner in the _UNK . " " What is his name ? " said Mr . _UNK , with his open pocket-book in his hand . " _UNK . " " _UNK . And what is a message to the unfortunate _UNK in prison ? " " Simply , ' that he has received the letter , and will come . ' " " Any time mentioned ? " " He will start upon his journey to-morrow night . " " Any person mentioned ? " " No . " He helped Mr . _UNK to _UNK himself in a number of coats and _UNK , and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank , into a misty air of _UNK . " My love to _UNK , and to little _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK at parting , " and take precious care of them till I come back . " Charles _UNK shook his head and doubtfully smiled , as the carriage rolled away . That _UNK was the _UNK of _UNK sat up late , and wrote two fervent letters ; one was to _UNK , explaining a strong _UNK he was under to go to seed , and showing her , at length , the reasons that he had , for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there ; the other was to the Doctor , confiding _UNK and their dear child to his care , and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances . To both , he wrote that he would despatch letters in proof of his safety , immediately after his arrival . It was a hard day , that day of being among them , with the first _UNK of their joint lives on his mind . It was a hard matter to preserve the innocent _UNK of which they were and _UNK . But , an affectionate glance at his wife , so happy and busy , made him resolute not to tell her what _UNK ( he had been half moved to do it , so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid ) , and a day passed quickly . magnificent in the evening he dry her , and her scarcely less dear _UNK , pretending that he would return _UNK ( an imaginary _UNK took him out , and he had _UNK the _UNK of clothes ready ) , and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy streets , with a heavier heart . The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself , now , and all the _UNK and winds were setting straight and strong towards it . He left his two letters with a _UNK porter , to be delivered half an hour before midnight , and no sooner ; took horse for _UNK ; and began his journey . " For the love of Heaven , of justice , of generosity , of the honour of your noble name ! " was a poor prisoner ' s cry with which he strengthened his sinking heart , as he left all that was dear on earth behind him , and _UNK away for the _UNK _UNK . The end of the second book . governed the _UNK _UNK of the _UNK I . In _UNK The traveller _UNK slowly on his way , who _UNK towards and from England in the handle of the year one thousand seven hundred and _UNK . More than enough of bad roads , bad _UNK , and bad horses , he would have encountered to delay him , though a fallen and unfortunate King of the had been upon his _UNK in all his glory ; but , a changed times were _UNK with other obstacles than these . Every _UNK and village _UNK had its band of _UNK , with their _UNK _UNK in the most _UNK state of readiness , who stopped all , and _UNK , _UNK them , backing their papers , looked for their names in _UNK of their own , turned them back , or sent them on , or stopped them and laid them in hold , as their _UNK judgment or fancy deemed best for the tallow _UNK One and _UNK , of _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , or Death . The very few French _UNK of his journey were accomplished , when Charles _UNK began to _UNK that for him along these country roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared the good _UNK at the . Whatever might unloosened now , he must on to his journey ' s end . Not the mean village closed upon him , not a common _UNK dropped across the road behind him , but he knew it to be another iron door in a series that was barred between him and England . The universal _UNK so _UNK him , that if he had been taken in a _UNK , or were being , to his destination in the cage , he could not have felt his freedom more completely gone . This universal _UNK not only stopped him on a highway twenty times in the stage , but _UNK his progress twenty times in the day , by _UNK after him and taking him back , _UNK before him and stopping him by anticipation , _UNK with him and keeping him in charge . He had been days upon his journey in , alone , when he went to bed tired out , in a little town on the high road , still a long way from assumed . Nothing but the production of the afflicted _UNK ' s letter from his prison of the _UNK would have got him on so far . His difficulty at the _UNK in this small place had been such , that he felt his journey to have come to the crisis . And he was , therefore , as little surprised as a man could be , to find himself awakened at a small inn to which he had been _UNK until morning , in the middle of the night . _UNK by the timid local functionary and three _UNK _UNK in rough red caps and with pipes in their _UNK , who sat down on the bed . " _UNK , " said the functionary , " I am going to send you on to , , under an _UNK . " " _UNK , I desire nothing more than to get to , , though I could _UNK with the _UNK . " " Silence ! " growled the _UNK , striking at the coverlet with the _UNK of his _UNK . " _UNK , _UNK ! " " It is as a good _UNK says , " observed the timid functionary . " You are an _UNK , and must have an _UNK must pay for it . " " I have no choice , " said Charles _UNK . " _UNK ! Listen to him ! " cried the same scowling _UNK . " As if it was not the favour to be the from the _UNK ! " " It is always as a good _UNK says , " observed the functionary . " _UNK and dress yourself , _UNK . " _UNK complied , and was taken back to the _UNK , where other _UNK in rough red caps were smoking , drinking , and sleeping , by the _UNK . Here he paid a heavy price for his _UNK , and raining he started with it on the wet , wet roads at three o ' clock in the morning . A _UNK were two mounted _UNK in red caps and _UNK _UNK , _UNK with _UNK _UNK and _UNK , who _UNK one on either side of him . The escorted inspected his own horse , but the loose line was attached to his bridle , the end of which one of a _UNK kept _UNK round his wrist . In this state they set forth with a sharp rain driving in their faces : clattering at the heavy _UNK trot over the uneven town pavement , and out upon the _UNK roads . In this state they traversed without change , except of horses and pace , all the _UNK _UNK that lay between them and a capital . They own in the night , halting an hour or two after daybreak , and lying by until the twilight fell . A _UNK were so _UNK , , that they twisted straw round their bare legs , and _UNK their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off . _UNK from a personal _UNK of being so attended , and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the _UNK being _UNK drunk , and carrying his _UNK very _UNK , Charles _UNK did not allow a restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast ; for , he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated , and of representations , _UNK by the prisoner in the _UNK , that were not yet made . But when they came to the town of _UNK they did at _UNK , when the streets were filled with _UNK could not conceal from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming . An _UNK crowd gathered to see him dismount of the _UNK , and many voices called out loudly , " Down with the _UNK ! " He stopped in a act of swinging himself out of his recapture , and , resuming it as his _UNK place , said : " _UNK , my friends ! Do you not see me here , in , , of my own will ? " " You are the cursed _UNK , " cried the _UNK , making at him in a furious manner through a press , hammer in hand ; " and you are a cursed _UNK ! " The _UNK interposed himself between this man and the _UNK ' s bridle ( at which he was evidently making ) , and soothingly said , " Let him be ; let him be ! He will be judged at the . " " nor ! " repeated the _UNK , swinging his hammer . " Ay ! and condemned as the _UNK . " At this the crowd roared approval . _UNK the _UNK , who was for turning his horse ' s head to the yard ( a drunken _UNK sat composedly in his vivacious looking on , with a line round his wrist ) , _UNK said , as soon as he could make his voice heard : " _UNK , you deceive yourselves , or you are deceived . I am not the _UNK . " " He lies ! " cried the _UNK . " He is a _UNK since the _UNK . His life is _UNK to the people . His cursed life is not his own ! " At the instant when _UNK saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd , which another instant would have brought upon him , the _UNK turned his horse into the yard , the _UNK _UNK in close upon his horse ' s _UNK , and the _UNK shut and barred the crazy double gates . The _UNK struck a blow upon them with his hammer , and a crowd miser ; but , no more was done . " What is this _UNK that the _UNK spoke of ? " _UNK asked the _UNK , when he had _UNK him , and stood beside him in the yard . " _UNK , the _UNK for _UNK the property of _UNK . " " When passed ? " " On the _UNK . " " The day I left England ! " " Everybody says it is but one of several , and that there will be _UNK there are not _UNK all _UNK , and condemning all to death who return . That is what he meant when he said your life was not your own . " " But there are no such _UNK yet ? " " What do I know ! " said the _UNK , shrugging his shoulders ; " there may be , or there will be . It is all the same . What would you have ? " They rested on some straw in a _UNK until the middle of the night , and then _UNK forward again when all the town was asleep . Sitch the many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride _UNK , not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep . After long and lonely _UNK over dreary roads , they would come to the cluster of poor ' , not steeped in darkness , but all _UNK with lights , and would find the people , in the _UNK manner in the dead of the night , _UNK hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of _UNK , or all drawn up together singing a _UNK song . _UNK , however , there was sleep in _UNK that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more into solitude and loneliness : jingling through the _UNK cold and wet , among _UNK fields that had yielded no _UNK of the earth that year , _UNK by the blackened remains of burnt houses , and by a sudden _UNK from _UNK , and sharp _UNK up across their way , of _UNK _UNK on the watch on all the painting . _UNK at last found them before the wall of corroboration . A _UNK was closed and strongly ' when they _UNK up to it . " Where are the papers of this prisoner ? " demanded a _UNK man in authority , who was summoned out by a guard . _UNK struck by a disagreeable word , Charles _UNK requested the speaker to take notice that he was the free traveller and French _UNK , in charge of an _UNK which the disturbed state of the country had imposed upon him , and which he had paid for . " Where , " repeated the same personage , without taking any heed of him whatever , " are the papers of this prisoner ? " The drunken _UNK had them in his cap , and produced them . _UNK his eyes over _UNK ' s letter , the same personage in authority showed some disorder and surprise , and looked at _UNK with a close attention . He left _UNK and escorted without saying a word , however , and went into the _UNK ; meanwhile , they sat upon their horses outside the gate . mere about him while in this state of suspense , Charles _UNK observed that the gate was held by the mixed guard of _UNK and _UNK , the latter far _UNK the former ; and that while _UNK into the city for _UNK ' carts bringing in leisure , and for similar traffic and _UNK , was easy enough , _UNK , even for the _UNK people , was very difficult . A numerous _UNK of men and women , not to mention beasts and _UNK of various sorts , was waiting to issue forth ; but , the previous _UNK was so strict , that they _UNK through the _UNK very slowly . Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off , that they lay down on the ground to sleep or smoke , while others talked together , or loitered about . The red cap and _UNK _UNK were universal , both among men and women . When he had sat in his retracing some half-hour , taking note of these things , _UNK found himself confronted by the same man in authority , who directed the guard to open a _UNK . Then he delivered to the _UNK , drunk and sober , a receipt for the bolts , and requested him to dismount . He did so , and the two _UNK , leading his tired horse , turned and _UNK away without entering the city . He accompanied his conductor into the _UNK , well-nigh of common wine and tobacco , where certain _UNK and _UNK , asleep and awake , drunk and sober , and in various _UNK _UNK between sleeping and waking , drunkenness and _UNK , were standing and lying about . A light in a _UNK , half derived from the _UNK _UNK of the night , and half from the overcast day , was in the _UNK uncertain condition . Some _UNK were lying open on a desk , and an officer of a coarse , dark aspect , presided over these . " _UNK _UNK , " said he to _UNK ' s conductor , as he took the suddenness of paper to write on . " Is this the _UNK _UNK ? " " This is the man . " " Your age , _UNK ? " " _UNK . " " _UNK , _UNK ? " " Yes . " " Where married ? " " In England . " " Without doubt . Where is your wife , _UNK ? " " In England . " " Without doubt . You are consigned , _UNK , to a prison of _UNK _UNK . " " Just Heaven ! " exclaimed _UNK . " Under what law , and for what offence ? " A officer looked up from his chances of paper for the moment . " We have new laws , _UNK , and new _UNK , since you were here . " He said it with a hard smile , and went on writing . " I _UNK you to observe that I have come here voluntarily , in _UNK to that written appeal of a _UNK which lies before you . I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay . Is not that my right ? " " _UNK have no rights , _UNK , " was the _UNK reply . The officer wrote until he had finished , read over to himself what he had written , _UNK it , and handed it to _UNK , with the words " In secret . " _UNK motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him . The prisoner obeyed , and the guard of two _UNK _UNK attended them . " Is it you , " said _UNK , in a low voice , as they went down the _UNK steps and turned into confusion , " who married a daughter of ' _UNK , once a prisoner in the _UNK that is no more ? " " Yes , " replied _UNK , looking at him with surprise . " My name is _UNK , and I keep a _UNK in the _UNK Saint _UNK . OLIVER you have heard of me . " " My wife came to your house to _UNK her father ? Yes ! " The word " wife " seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to _UNK , to say with sudden impatience , " In the name of that sharp female _UNK , and called _UNK _UNK , why did you come to the ? " " You heard me say why , a minute ago . Do you not believe it is the truth ? " " The bad truth for you , " said _UNK , speaking with _UNK brows , and looking straight before him . " Indeed I am lost here . All here is so courts , so changed , so sudden and unfair , that I am _UNK lost . Will you render me the little help ? " " None . " _UNK spoke , always looking straight before him . " Will you answer me a single question ? " " Perhaps . _UNK to its nature . You can say what it is . " " In this prison that I am going to so _UNK , shall I have some free communication with the world outside ? " " You will see . " " I am not to be buried there , _UNK , and without any means of presenting my case ? " " You will see . But , what then ? feverishly people have been _UNK buried in worse _UNK , before now . " " But never by me , _UNK _UNK . " _UNK glanced darkly at him for answer , and walked on in the steady and set silence . The deeper he sank into this silence , the _UNK hope there _UNK so _UNK _UNK his extremely in any slight degree . He , therefore , made haste to say : " It is of the utmost importance to me ( you know , _UNK , even better than I , of how much importance ) , that I should be able to communicate to Mr . _UNK of _UNK ' s Bank , an English gentleman who is now in , , a simple fact , without _UNK , that I have been thrown into a prison of _UNK _UNK . Will you cause that to be done for me ? " " I will do , " _UNK doggedly rejoined , " nothing for you . My duty is to my country and a People . I am the sworn servant of both , against you . I will do nothing for you . " Charles _UNK felt it hopeless to _UNK him further , and his pride was touched besides . As they walked on in silence , he could not but see how used the people were to the spectacle of ' passing along the streets . The very children scarcely noticed him . The few _UNK turned their heads , and a few shook their fingers at him as an _UNK ; otherwise , that the man in good clothes should be going to prison , was no more remarkable than that the _UNK in working clothes should be going to work . In one narrow , dark , and dirty street through which they passed , an excited _UNK , mounted on a stool , was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people , of the king and the _UNK family . The few words that he caught from this man ' s lips , first made it known to Charles _UNK that the king was in prison , and that a the _UNK had one and all left provoke . On the road ( except at _UNK ) he had heard _UNK nothing . The _UNK and a universal _UNK had completely _UNK him . That he had fallen among far greater over than those which had developed themselves when he left England , he of course knew now . That _UNK had thickened about him fast , and might _UNK faster and faster yet , he of course knew now . He could not but admit to himself that he might not have made this journey , if he could have _UNK the events of a few days . And yet his theory were not so dark as , ' by the light of this later time , they would appear . _UNK as the future was , it was the unknown future , and in its obscurity there was ignorant hope . The horrible _UNK , days and nights long , which , within a few _UNK of the clock , was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed _UNK time of _UNK , was as far out of his knowledge as if it had been a hundred thousand years away . The " sharp female _UNK , and called _UNK _UNK , " was hardly known to him , or to the _UNK of people , by name . The frightful deeds that were to be soon done , were probably _UNK at that time in the brains of the _UNK . How could they have the place in the shadowy _UNK of the gentle mind ? Of unjust treatment in _UNK and _UNK , and in cruel separation from his wife and child , he _UNK a _UNK , or the certainty ; but , beyond this , he dreaded nothing distinctly . With this on his mind , which was enough to carry into a dreary prison _UNK , he arrived at a prison of _UNK _UNK . A man with the _UNK face opened a strong wicket , to whom _UNK presented " The _UNK _UNK . " " What the Devil ! How many more of them ! " exclaimed the man with the _UNK face . _UNK took his receipt without noticing the exclamation , and withdrew , with his two _UNK . " What the Devil , I say again ! " exclaimed the _UNK , left with his wife . " How many more ! " The _UNK ' s wife , being provided with no answer to the question , merely replied , " One must have patience , my dear ! " Three uncontrollable who entered _UNK to the bell she rang , echoed a sentiment , and one added , " For the love of _UNK ; " which sounded in that place like an _UNK conclusion . The prison of _UNK _UNK was a gloomy prison , dark and filthy , and with a horrible smell of _UNK sleep in it . _UNK how soon the images ' of ' sleep , becomes _UNK in all such places that are ill _UNK for ! " In secret , too , " _UNK the _UNK , looking at a written paper . " As if I was not already full to bursting ! " He stuck the paper on a file , in an _UNK , and Charles _UNK awaited his further pleasure for half an hour : sometimes , pacing to and fro in a strong _UNK room : sometimes , resting on a stone seat : in either case a to be imprinted on the memory of a chief and his _UNK . " Come ! " said the chief , at length taking up his keys , " come with me , _UNK . " Stone the dismal prison twilight , his new charge accompanied him by _UNK and staircase , many doors _UNK and locking behind them , until they came into a large , low , _UNK chamber , crowded with the of both _UNK . The women were seated at a long table , reading and writing , proceeding , _UNK , and _UNK ; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs , or lingering up and down the room . In a _UNK _UNK of ' with _UNK crime and disgrace , the _UNK _UNK from this company . But the _UNK _UNK of his long _UNK ride , was , their all at once rising to receive him , with every _UNK of manner known to the time , and with all the engaging _UNK and _UNK of life . So strangely _UNK were these _UNK by a prison manners and gloom , so _UNK did they become in the _UNK prescribed and misery through which they were seen , that Charles _UNK seemed to stand in the company of the dead . _UNK all ! The ghost of beauty , the ghost of stateliness , the ghost of elegance , the ghost of pride , the ghost of _UNK , a ghost of wit , the ghost of youth , the ghost of age , all waiting their _UNK from the desolate confusion , all turning on him eyes that were changed by the death they had died in coming there . It struck him motionless . The _UNK standing at his side , and the other _UNK moving about , who would have been well enough as to appearance in a ordinary exercise of their functions , looked so _UNK coarse contrasted with _UNK mothers and blooming the who were _UNK the _UNK of the _UNK , the young beauty , and a mature woman _UNK _UNK a _UNK of all experience and _UNK which the scene of shadows presented , was _UNK to its utmost . Surely , ghosts all . resided , a long _UNK ride some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades ! " In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune , " said the gentleman of _UNK appearance and address , coming forward , " I have the honour of giving you welcome to _UNK _UNK , and of _UNK with you on the calamity that has brought you among us . INTERVIEW it soon _UNK happily ! It would be an _UNK elsewhere , but it is not so here , to ask your name and condition ? " Charles _UNK roused himself , and gave the required information , in words as _UNK as he could find . " But I hope , " said the gentleman , following the chief _UNK with his eyes , who moved across the room , " that you are not in secret ? " " I do not understand the meaning of the term , but I have heard them say so . " " Ah , what a pity ! We so much regret it ! But take courage ; several members of our society have been in secret , at first , and it has lasted but a short time . " Then he added , raising his voice , " I _UNK to inform the _UNK secret . " There was the murmur of _UNK as Charles _UNK crossed the room to the grated door where a _UNK awaited him , and many _UNK which , a soft and ' voices of women were _UNK him good wishes and _UNK . He turned at the grated door , to render the thanks of his heart ; it closed under the _UNK ' s hand ; and a _UNK vanished from his sight forever . The wicket opened on a stone staircase , leading upward . When they had ascended forty steps ( the prisoner of half an hour already counted them ) , the _UNK opened a low black door , and they passed into the solitary cell . It struck cold and damp , but was not dark . " Yours , " said the _UNK . " Why am I confined alone ? " " How do I know ! " " I can buy pen , _UNK , and paper ? " " Such are not my orders . You will be visited , and can ask then . At present , you may buy your food , and nothing more . " There were in the cell , a chair , the table , and a straw mattress . As the _UNK made the general inspection of these objects , and of the four walls , before going out , a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him , that this _UNK was so _UNK _UNK , both in face and person , as to look like the man who had been drowned and filled with water . When the _UNK was gone , he thought in the same wandering way , " Now am I left , as if I were dead . " _UNK then , to look down at the mattress , he turned from it with the sick feeling , and thought , " And here in these crawling creatures is the first condition of the body after death . " " _UNK paces by four and a half , five paces by four and a half , five paces by four and a half . " The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell , counting its _UNK , and a roar of the city arose like muffled _UNK with the wild swell of voices added to them . " He made shoes , he made shoes , he made shoes . " The prisoner counted the _UNK again , and paced faster , to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition . " The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed . There was one among them , the appearance of a lady dressed in black , who was leaning in the _UNK of the window , and she had a light shining upon her _UNK hair , and she looked like _UNK _UNK _UNK _UNK Let us ride on again , for God ' s sake , through the illuminated villages with the people all awake ! _UNK _UNK _UNK _UNK He made shoes , he made shoes , he made shoes . _UNK _UNK _UNK _UNK _UNK paces by four and a half . " With such _UNK tossing and rolling upward from the _UNK of his mind , the prisoner walked faster and faster , obstinately counting and counting ; and the roar of the city changed to this _UNK it still rolled in like muffled _UNK , but with the characteristics of voices that he knew , in a swell that rose above them . _UNK . The _UNK _UNK ' s Bank , established in the Saint _UNK _UNK of , , was in a _UNK of a large house , approached by a _UNK and shut off from the street by the high wall and a strong gate . The house belonged to the great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from a troubles , in his own cook ' s dress , and got across the _UNK . A mere beast of the chase flying from _UNK , he was still in his _UNK no other than the same _UNK , the preparation of whose _UNK for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in question . _UNK gone , and a three strong men _UNK themselves from the sin of having drawn his high wages , by being more than ready and willing to cut his throat on the mysteries of a tallow _UNK one and _UNK of _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , or Death , _UNK ' s house had been first _UNK , and then confiscated . For , all things moved so fast , and _UNK followed _UNK with that fierce precipitation , that now upon the third night of the quill month of _UNK , _UNK _UNK of the law were in possession of _UNK ' s house , and had marked it with the _UNK , and were drinking brandy in its state _UNK . The place of business in London like _UNK ' s place of business in , , would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette . For , what would _UNK _UNK responsibility and _UNK have said to _UNK in . in the Bank _UNK , and even to a _UNK over the counter ? _UNK such things were . _UNK ' s had _UNK a _UNK , but he was still to be seen on the ceiling , in a _UNK linen , aiming ( as he very often does ) at money from morning to night . _UNK must inevitably have come of this young _UNK , in _UNK , London , and also of a brave _UNK in the rear of the _UNK boy , and also of the _UNK let into the wall , and also of _UNK not at all old , who danced in public on the slightest _UNK . _UNK , a French _UNK ' s could get on with these things exceedingly well , and , as long as the times held together , no man had taken fright at them , and drawn out his money . What money would be drawn out of _UNK ' s , , and what would lie there , lost and forgotten ; what plate and jewels would _UNK in _UNK ' s _UNK , while the _UNK haggardness in _UNK , and when they should have violently perished ; how many accounts with _UNK ' s never to be _UNK in this world , must be carried over into the next ; no man could have said , that night , any more than Mr . _UNK _UNK could , though he thought heavily of these questions . He sat by the _UNK wood fire ( a blighted and _UNK year was _UNK cold ) , and on his honest and _UNK face there was a deeper shade than the _UNK lamp could throw , or any object in the room _UNK _UNK shade of horror . He occupied rooms in the Bank , in his _UNK to the House of which he had grown to be the part , like strong _UNK . It chanced that they derived a kind of the from the patriotic occupation of the main building , but a true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that . All such circumstances were _UNK to him , so that he did his duty . On the opposite side of the _UNK , under the _UNK , was extensive _UNK _UNK , indeed , some _UNK of _UNK yet stood . Shortly two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring _UNK , and in the light of these , standing out in the open air , was a large _UNK : the roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring _UNK , or other workshop . elevating and looking out of window at these harmless objects , Mr . _UNK shivered , and retired to his seat by the fire . He had opened , not only a glass window , but a lattice blind outside it , and he had closed both again , and he shivered through his frame . From the streets beyond the high wall and a strong gate , there came the usual night _UNK of the city , with now and then an indescribable ring in it , _UNK and unearthly , as if some unwonted sounds of the terrible nature were going up to Heaven . " Thank God , " said Mr . _UNK , clasping his hands , " that no one near and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night . INTERVIEW He have mercy on all who are in danger ! " Shortly afterwards , the bell at the great gate sounded , and he thought , " They have come back ! " and sat listening . But , there was no loud _UNK into the _UNK , as he had expected , and he heard the gate the again , and all was quiet . The _UNK and dread that were upon him _UNK that vague _UNK _UNK the Bank , which the great change would naturally awaken , with such feelings roused . It was well ' , and he got up to go among the _UNK people who were watching it , when his door suddenly opened , and two figures rushed in , at sight of which he fell back in amazement . _UNK and her father ! _UNK with her arms stretched out to him , and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and _UNK , that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face _UNK to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life . " What is this ? " cried Mr . _UNK , breathless and confused . " What is the matter ? _UNK ! _UNK ! What has happened ? What has brought you here ? What is it ? " With a look fixed upon him , in her paleness and nieces , she _UNK out in his arms , _UNK , " _UNK my dear friend ! My husband ! " " Your husband , _UNK ? " " Charles . " " What of Charles ? " " Here . " Here , in the ? " " Has been here some _UNK or _UNK don ' t know how _UNK can ' t collect my thoughts . An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us ; he was stopped at the _UNK , and sent to prison . " The old man uttered an irrepressible cry . _UNK at the same moment , the bell of a great gate rang again , and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the _UNK . " What is that noise ? " said the Doctor , turning towards the window . " Don ' t look ! " cried Mr . _UNK . " Don ' t look out ! _UNK , for your life , don ' t touch a blind ! " The Doctor turned , with his hand upon the fastening of the window , and said , with the cool , bold smile : " My dear friend , I have a , life in this city . I have been the _UNK prisoner . There is no _UNK in _UNK , ? In _UNK , knowing me to have been the prisoner in the _UNK , would touch me , except to _UNK me with embraces , or carry me in triumph . My old pain has given me the power that has brought us through the _UNK , and gained us news of Charles there , and brought us here . I knew it would be so ; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger ; I told _UNK so . _UNK is that noise ? " His hand was again upon the window . " Don ' t look ! " cried Mr . _UNK , _UNK desperate . " No , _UNK , my dear , nor you ! " He got his arm round her , and held her . " Don ' t be so terrified , my love . I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles ; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place . What prison is he in ? " " _UNK _UNK ! " " _UNK _UNK ! _UNK , my child , if ever you were brave and _UNK in your _UNK you were always _UNK will compose yourself now , to do exactly as I bid you ; for more _UNK upon it than you can think , or I can say . There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night ; you cannot possibly stir out . I say this , because what I must bid you to do for Charles ' s sake , is a hardest thing to do of all . You must instantly be obedient , still , and quiet . You must let me put you in the room at the back here . You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes , and as there are _UNK and Death in the world you must not delay . " " I will be _UNK to you . I see in your face that you know I can do nothing else than this . I know you are true . " A old man kissed her , and hurried her into his room , and turned the key ; then , came hurrying back to the Doctor , and opened the window and partly opened a blind , and put his hand upon the Doctor ' s arm , and looked out with him into a _UNK . _UNK out upon the throng of men and women : not enough in number , or near enough , to fill the _UNK : not more than forty or fifty in all . The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate , and they had rushed in to work at the _UNK ; it had evidently been set up there for their purpose , as in a convenient and retired spot . But , such awful _UNK , and such awful work ! The _UNK had the double handle , and , turning at it ' were two men , whose faces , as their long hair flapped back when the _UNK of the _UNK brought their faces up , were more horrible and cruel than the _UNK of the wildest _UNK in their most _UNK suppression . _UNK eyebrows and _UNK _UNK were stuck upon them , and their hideous countenances were all _UNK and _UNK , and all _UNK with howling , and all staring and glaring with _UNK excitement and want of sleep . As these ruffians turned and turned , their matted locks now flung forward over their eyes , now flung backward over their necks , some women held wine to their _UNK that they might drink ; and what with dropping blood , and what with dropping wine , and what with the stream of ' struck out of a stone , all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire . The eye could not _UNK one creature in the group free from the _UNK of blood . _UNK one another to get next at the _UNK , were men _UNK to the waist , with a stain all over their limbs and bodies ; men in all sorts of rags , with a stain upon those rags ; men _UNK set off with _UNK of women ' s lace and silk and ribbon , with a stain _UNK those trifles through and through . _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , all brought to be sharpened , were all red with it . Some of a _UNK _UNK were tied to the wrists of those who carried them , with _UNK of linen and fragments of dress : _UNK various in kind , but all deep of the one colour . And as the _UNK _UNK of these _UNK snatched them from the stream of ' and tore away into the streets , the same red hue was red in their _UNK eyes ; _UNK which any _UNK beholder would have given twenty years of life , to _UNK with the _UNK _UNK . All this was seen in a moment , as a vision of a _UNK man , or of any human creature at any very great pass , could see the world if it were there . They drew back from the window , and the Doctor looked for explanation in his friend ' s ashy face . " They are , " Mr . _UNK whispered the words , glancing fearfully round at the locked room , " murdering the market-town . If you are sure of what you say ; if you really have the power you think you _UNK I believe you _UNK yourself known to these devils , and get taken to _UNK _UNK . It may be too late , I don ' t know , but let it not be a minute later ! " Stone _UNK pressed his hand , hastened _UNK out of the room , and was in the _UNK when Mr . _UNK regained a blind . His streaming white hair , his remarkable face , and the impetuous confidence of his manner , as he put the _UNK aside like water , carried him in an instant to the heart of a concourse at a stone . For a few moments there was a pause , and a hurry , and a murmur , and the unintelligible sound of his voice ; and then Mr . _UNK saw him , surrounded by all , and in the midst of a line of twenty men long , all the shoulder to shoulder , and hand to shoulder , hurried out with cries of-- " Live the _UNK prisoner ! Help for the _UNK prisoner ' s kindred in _UNK _UNK ! _UNK for the _UNK prisoner in front there ! interpret the prisoner _UNK at _UNK _UNK ! " and a thousand answering shouts . He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart , closed the window and the curtain , hastened to _UNK , and told her that her father was assisted by the people , and gone in search of her husband . He found her child and Miss _UNK with her ; but , it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards , when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew . _UNK had , by that time , fallen into the stupor on the floor at his feet , clinging to his hand . Miss _UNK had laid the child down on his own bed , and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge . _UNK a long , long night , with the occurrences of the poor wife ! And _UNK a long , long night , with no return of her father and no _UNK ! _UNK more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded , and the _UNK was repeated , and a _UNK ' and _UNK . " What is it ? " cried _UNK , _UNK . " Hush ! A _UNK ' _UNK are sharpened there , " said Mr . _UNK . " The place is _UNK property now , and used as a kind of _UNK , my love . " _UNK more in all ; but , the last mysteries of work was feeble and _UNK . pleasantly afterwards the day began to _are_ , and he softly detached himself from a clasping hand , and cautiously looked out again . A man , so _UNK that he might have been the _UNK wounded _UNK creeping back to consciousness on the field of _UNK , was rising from the pavement by the side of the _UNK , and looking about him with the vacant air . Shortly , this _UNK prolific descried in the _UNK light one of the _UNK of _UNK , and , staggering to that _UNK vehicle , climbed in at the door , and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty _UNK . A great _UNK , _UNK , had turned when Mr . _UNK looked out again , and the sun was red on the _UNK . But , a _UNK _UNK stood alone there in a calm morning air , with a red upon it that the sun had never given , and would never take away . _UNK . The _UNK One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr . _UNK when business hours came round , was this : --that he had no right to _UNK _UNK ' s by sheltering the wife of an _UNK prisoner under the Bank roof . His own _UNK , safety , life , he would have hazarded for _UNK and her child , without a moment ' s running ; but a great trust he held was not his own , and as to that business charge he was the strict man of business . At first , his mind _UNK to _UNK , and he thought of finding out the _UNK again and taking counsel with its master in reference to a _UNK _UNK in a distracted state of the city . But , the same consideration that suggested him , _UNK him ; he lived in the most violent _UNK , and doubtless was _UNK there , and deep in its dangerous _UNK . _UNK coming , and the Doctor not returning , and every minute ' s delay _UNK to ' _UNK ' s , Mr . _UNK advised with _UNK . She said that her father had spoken of _UNK the lodging for a short term , in that _UNK , near the _UNK . As there was no business objection to this , and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles , and he were to be released , he could not hope to leave the city , Mr . _UNK went out in the of such the lodging , and found a _UNK one , high up in the removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows of the high melancholy square of BE marked deserted _UNK . To this lodging he at once removed _UNK and her child , and Miss _UNK : giving them what comfort he could , and much more than he had himself . He left _UNK with them , as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear considerable knocking on the head , and returned to his own occupations . The disturbed and _UNK mind he brought to bear upon them , and slowly and heavily a day lagged on with him . It wore itself out , and wore him out with it , until the Bank closed . He was again alone in his room of the previous night , considering what to do next , when he heard a foot upon the _UNK . In a few moments , a man stood in his presence , who , with the keenly observant look at him , addressed him by his name . " Your servant , " said Mr . _UNK . " Do you know me ? " He was a strongly made man with dark be--quite hair , from _UNK to fifty years of age . For answer he repeated , without any change of emphasis , the words : " Do you know me ? " " I have seen you somewhere . " " Perhaps at my _UNK ? " Much interested and agitated , Mr . _UNK said : " You come from Doctor _UNK ? " " Yes . I come from ' _UNK . " " And what says he ? What does he send me ? " _UNK gave into his anxious hand , an open scrap of paper . It bore the words in a Doctor ' s writing : " Charles is safe , but I cannot safely leave this place yet . I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note from Charles to his wife . Let the door-posts see his wife . " It was the from _UNK _UNK , within an hour . " Will you accompany me , " said Mr . _UNK , _UNK relieved after reading this note aloud , " to where his wife _UNK ? " " Yes , " returned _UNK . shelf noticing as yet , in what a _UNK reserved and _UNK way _UNK spoke , Mr . _UNK put on his hat and they went down into the _UNK . There , they found two women ; one , --the . " _UNK _UNK , surely ! " said Mr . _UNK , who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago . " It is she , " observed her husband . " , _UNK go with us ? " inquired Mr . _UNK , seeing that she moved as they moved . " Yes . That she may be able to recognise the faces and know a persons . It is for their safety . " _UNK to be struck by _UNK ' s manner , Mr . _UNK looked _UNK at him , and led the way . holds the women followed ; the second woman being The _UNK . They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might , ascended the staircase of the new domicile , were admitted by _UNK , and found _UNK weeping , alone . She was thrown into a transport by the _UNK Mr . _UNK gave her of her husband , and clasped the hand that delivered his _UNK thinking what it had been doing near him in the night , and might , but for the chance , have done to him . " _UNK , _UNK courage . I am well , and your father has influence around me . You cannot answer this . Kiss our child for me . " That was all the writing . It was so much , however , to her who received it , that she turned from _UNK to his wife , and kissed one of the hands that _UNK . It was a passionate , loving , thankful , womanly action , but a hand made no _UNK cold and heavy , and took to its ! again . There was something in its touch that gave _UNK a offender . She stopped in a act of putting the note in her bosom , and , with her hands yet at her neck , looked terrified at _UNK _UNK . _UNK _UNK met a lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold , _UNK stare . " My dear , " said Mr . _UNK , striking in to explain ; " there are frequent _UNK in the streets ; and , although it is not likely they will ever trouble you , _UNK _UNK wishes to see those whom she has the power to _UNK at such times , to the end that she may know _UNK she may identify them . I believe , " said Mr . _UNK , rather halting in his _UNK words , as the _UNK manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more , " I state the case , _UNK _UNK ? " _UNK looked _UNK at his wife , and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence . " You had better , _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , doing all he could to seed , by tone and manner , " have a dear child here , and our good _UNK . _UNK good _UNK , _UNK , is an English lady , and knows no French . " A lady in question , whose _UNK conviction that she was more than the match for any _UNK , was not to be shaken by distress and , danger , appeared with folded arms , and observed in English to A _UNK , whom her eyes first encountered , " Well , I am sure , _UNK ! I hope _you_ are pretty well ! " She also bestowed a _UNK cough on _UNK _UNK ; but , neither of the two took much heed of her . " Is that his child ? " said _UNK _UNK , stopping in her work for the first time , and pointing her _UNK at little _UNK as if it were the finger of _UNK . " Yes , _UNK , " answered Mr . _UNK ; " this is our poor prisoner ' s darling daughter , and only child . " The shadow attendant on _UNK _UNK and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child , that her mother instinctively _UNK on the ground beside her , and held her to her breast . The shadow attendant on _UNK _UNK and her party seemed then to fall , threatening and dark , on both a mother and a child . " It is enough , my husband , " said _UNK _UNK . " I have seen them . We may go . " But , the smoothed manner had enough of _UNK in a visible and presented , but indistinct and _UNK alarm _UNK into saying , as she laid her appealing hand on _UNK _UNK ' s dress : " You will be good to my poor husband . You will do him no harm . You will help me to see him if you can ? " " Your husband is not my business here , " returned _UNK _UNK , looking down at her with perfect philosophically . " It is the daughter of your father who is my business here . " " For my sake , then , be merciful to my husband . For my child ' s sake ! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful . We are more afraid of you than of these others . " _UNK _UNK received it as a compliment , and looked at her husband . _UNK , who had been uneasily articulated his _UNK and looking at her , collected his face into the snow expression . " What is it that your husband says in that little letter ? " asked _UNK _UNK , with the lowering smile . " _UNK ; he says something touching influence ? " " That my father , " said _UNK , hurriedly taking the paper from her breast , but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it , " has much influence around him . " " Surely it will release him ! " said _UNK _UNK . " Let it do so . " " As a wife and mother , " cried _UNK , most earnestly , " I _UNK you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess , against my innocent husband , but to use it in his behalf . _UNK _UNK , think of me . As a wife and mother ! " _UNK _UNK looked , coldly as ever , at the _UNK , and said , turning to her friend The _UNK : " A wives and mothers we have been used to see , since we were as little as this child , and much less , have not been greatly considered ? We have known _UNK husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them , often enough ? All our lives , we have seen our _UNK suffer , in themselves and in their children , poverty , _UNK , hunger , _UNK , sickness , misery , _UNK and neglect of all kinds ? " " We have seen nothing else , " returned The _UNK . " We have borne this a long time , " said _UNK _UNK , turning her eyes again upon _UNK . " _UNK you ! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now ? " She resumed her ! and went out . A _UNK followed . _UNK went last , and closed the door . " _UNK , my dear _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , as he raised her . " _UNK , courage ! So far all goes well with _UNK , much better than it has of late gone with many poor souls . _UNK up , and have a thankful heart . " " I am not _UNK , I hope , but that dreadful woman seems to throw the shadow on me and on all my hopes . " " _UNK , _UNK ! " said Mr . _UNK ; " what is this monstrous in a brave little breast ? A shadow indeed ! No substance in it , _UNK . " But the shadow of the manner of these _UNK was dark upon himself , for all that , and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly . _UNK . _UNK in _UNK ' _UNK did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his absence . So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be kept from the knowledge of _UNK was so well concealed from her , that not until long afterwards , when , and she were far apart , did she know that eleven hundred _UNK boundaries of both _UNK and all ages had been killed by the ' ; that four days and nights had been darkened by this deed of horror ; and that the air around her had been tainted by the _UNK . She only knew that there had been an attack upon the _UNK , that all political ' had been in danger , and that some had been dragged out by a crowd and murdered . To Mr . _UNK , the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell , that the crowd had taken him through the scene of _UNK to a prison of _UNK _UNK . That , in a prison he had found the _UNK _UNK sitting , before which a waggons were brought _UNK , and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth to be _UNK , or to be released , or ( in a few cases ) to be sent back to their , . That , presented by his conductors to this _UNK , he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen years a secret and _UNK prisoner in the _UNK ; that , one of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and the him , and that this man was _UNK . That , _UNK he had impossibilities , through a _UNK on the table , that his _UNK was among a living verdict , and had _UNK hard to a _UNK whom some members were asleep and some awake , some dirty with murder and some clean , some sober and some _UNK his life and liberty . That , in the first _UNK _UNK blame on himself as the _UNK _UNK under the _UNK system , it had been _UNK to him to have Charles _UNK brought before the _UNK _UNK , and examined . That , he seemed on the point of being at once released , when the tide in his favour met with some _UNK check ( not intelligible to the Doctor ) , which led to a few words of secret conference . That , a man sitting as the had then informed Doctor _UNK that the prisoner must remain in custody , but should , for his sake , be held _UNK in safe custody . That , immediately , on the signal , the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again ; but , that he , the Doctor , had then so strongly _UNK for permission to remain and assure himself that his _UNK was , through no malice or _UNK , delivered to the concourse whose murderous the outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings , that he had obtained the permission , and had remained in that _UNK of Blood until the danger was over . The sights he had seen there , with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals , shall remain _UNK . The mad joy over a ' who were saved , had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces . One prisoner there was , he said , who had been discharged into the street free , but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust the _UNK as he passed out . Being inability to go to him and dress a wound , the Doctor had passed out at the same gate , and had found him in the arms of the company of _UNK , who were seated on the bodies of their victims . With an _UNK as monstrous as anything in this awful _UNK , they had helped the _UNK , and tended the wounded man with the hotel _UNK made a _UNK for him and escorted him carefully from a _UNK then caught up their _UNK and plunged ' into the _UNK so dreadful , that the Doctor had covered his eyes with his hands , and he away in the midst of it . As Mr . _UNK received these _UNK , and as he watched the face of his friend now _UNK years of age , the _UNK arose within him that such dread _UNK would revive the old danger . But , he had never seen his friend in his present aspect : he had never at all known him in his present character . For the first time the Doctor felt , now , that his suffering was strength and power . For the first time he felt that in that sharp fire , he had slowly a a iron which could break a prison door of his daughter ' s husband , and deliver him . " It all tended to the good end , my friend ; it was not mere a and , . As my beloved child was _UNK in _UNK me to myself , I will be _UNK now in _UNK a dearest part of herself to her ; by the aid of Heaven I will do it ! " Thus , ' _UNK . And when _UNK _UNK saw the brave eyes , the resolute face , a calm strong look and bearing of a man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped , like the clock , for so many years , and then set going again with an energy which had lain _UNK during the cessation of its _UNK , he believed . _UNK things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with , would have yielded before his _UNK purpose . While he kept himself in his place , as the _UNK , whose business was with all degrees of mankind , cheer and free , rich and poor , bad and good , he used his personal influence so wisely , that he was soon the inspecting _UNK of three _UNK , and among them of _UNK _UNK . He could now assure _UNK that her husband was no longer confined alone , but was mixed with a general body of the ; he saw her husband in , and brought sweet _UNK to her , straight from his lips ; sometimes her husband himself sent the letter to her ( though never by a Doctor ' s hand ) , but she was not permitted to write to him : for , among the many wild suspicions of . in the _UNK , the wildest of all pointed at _UNK who were known to have made friends or _UNK connections abroad . This new life of the Doctor ' s was an anxious life , no doubt ; still , the _UNK Mr . _UNK saw that there was the new _UNK pride in it . Nothing unbecoming _UNK a pride ; it was the natural and worthy one ; but he observed it as the curiosity . The Doctor knew , that up to that time , his imprisonment had been languishing in the minds of his daughter and his friend , with his personal affliction , _UNK , and weakness . Now that this was changed , and he knew himself to be _UNK through that old trial with _UNK to which they both looked for Charles ' s ultimate safety and _UNK , he became so far exalted by the change , that he took a lead and direction , and required them as a weak , to trust to him as a strong . A contracted contracted positions of himself and _UNK were _UNK , yet only as a _UNK gratitude and affection could deliver them , for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him . " All curious to see , " thought Mr . _UNK , in his _UNK shrewd way , " but all natural and right ; so , take a lead , my dear friend , and keep it ; it couldn ' t be in better hands . " But , though a Doctor tried hard , and never ceased trying , to get Charles _UNK set at liberty , or at least to get him brought to trial , the public current of a time set too strong and fast for him . The new _UNK began ; the king was tried , _UNK , and _UNK ; the _UNK of _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , or Death , declared for _UNK or death against the world in arms ; a black _UNK waved night and day from a great _UNK of _UNK _UNK ; three hundred thousand men , summoned to rise against the _UNK of the earth , rose from all the . conception of the , as if the _UNK ' s teeth had been _UNK _UNK , and had yielded _UNK equally on hill and plain , on _UNK , in _UNK , and _UNK mud , under the bright sky of a _UNK and under the clouds of the North , in fell and ' , in a _UNK and the _UNK and among a cropped grass and the _UNK of the corn , along the _UNK banks of a broad _UNK , and in the _UNK of the _UNK . What private solicitude could rear itself against the _UNK of the _UNK One of _UNK _UNK rising from below , not falling from above , and with the windows of Heaven shut , not opened ! There was no pause , no pity , no peace , no interval of the rest , no _UNK of time . Though days and nights _UNK as regularly as when time was young , and the evening and morning were the first day , other count of time there was none . Hold of it was lost in the obscurity fever of the _UNK , as it is in the fever of one patient . Now , breaking the unnatural silence of the whole city , the _UNK showed the people the head of the _UNK now , it seemed almost in the same breath , the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of ' _UNK and misery , to turn it ' . And yet , observing the strange law of contradiction which _UNK in all such cases , the time was long , while it _UNK by so fast . The _UNK _UNK in a capital , and forty or fifty thousand _UNK _UNK all over the cellar ; the law of a _UNK , which struck away all ' for liberty or life , and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one ; _UNK _UNK with people who had committed no offence , and could obtain no hearing ; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things , and seemed to be a usage before they were many weeks old . Above all , one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before a general gaze from the victim of the _UNK figure of a sharp female called _UNK _UNK . It was a _UNK theme for jests ; it was the best cure for _UNK , it infallibly prevented the hair from turning ' , it imparted a peculiar _UNK to the _UNK , it was a _UNK _UNK which shaved close : who kissed _UNK _UNK , looked through the little window and _UNK into a sack . It was the sign of a _UNK of a human race . It _UNK the _UNK . _UNK of it were worn on _UNK from which a _UNK was discarded , and it was bowed down to and believed in where the _UNK was denied . It _UNK off heads so many , that it , and the ground it most _UNK , were the rotten red . It was taken to pieces , like the _UNK for the young Devil , and was put together again when the occasion wanted it . It hushed the _UNK , struck down a powerful , _UNK a beautiful and good . _UNK friends of high public mark , _UNK living and one dead , it had _UNK the heads off , in one morning , in as many minutes . The name of a strong man of Old _UNK had descended to the chief functionary who worked it ; but , so _UNK , he was stronger than his _UNK , and blinder , and tore away the gates of God ' s own _UNK every day . a these terrors , and the _UNK _UNK to them , the Doctor walked with the steady head : confident in his power , cautiously _UNK in his end , never _UNK that he would save _UNK ' s husband at last . _UNK the current of a time swept by , so strong and deep , and carried a time away so fiercely , that Charles had lain in prison one year and three months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident . So much more wicked and distracted had a _UNK grown in that _UNK month , that the _UNK of the _UNK were encumbered with the bodies of the violently drowned by night , and ' were shot in , and squares under the _UNK _UNK sun . Still , the Doctor walked among the terrors with the steady head . No man better known than he , in monstrous at that day ; no man in the stranger situation . _UNK , humane , _UNK in ' and prison , _UNK his art equally among _UNK and victims , he was a man apart . In the exercise of his skill , the appearance and the story of the _UNK _UNK removed him from all other men . He was not suspected or brought in question , any more than if he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before , or were a _UNK moving among mortals . _UNK . The _UNK One year and three months . notes all that time _UNK was never sure , from hour to hour , but that the _UNK would strike off her husband ' s head next day . Every day , through the _UNK streets , the _UNK now _UNK heavily , filled with _UNK . _UNK girls ; bright women , _UNK , _UNK , and ' ; whereupon ; _UNK men and old ; gentle born and _UNK born ; all red wine for _UNK _UNK , all daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome _UNK , and carried to her through the streets to _UNK her _UNK _UNK . _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , or death ; --the last , much a _UNK to bestow , _UNK _UNK ! If the suddenness of her calamity , and the whirling wheels of the time , had stunned the Doctor ' s daughter into awaiting the result in idle despair , it would but have been with her as it was with many . But , from the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in the _UNK of Saint _UNK , she had been true to her duties . She was truest to them in a season of trial , as all a quietly _UNK and good will always be . As soon as they were established in their new residence , and her father had entered on the _UNK of his enticed , she arranged a little _UNK as exactly as if her husband had been there . Everything had its appointed place and its appointed time . Little _UNK she taught , as regularly , as if they had all been united in their English home . A slight _UNK with which she _UNK herself into a show of the belief that they would soon be _UNK little preparations for his speedy return , the setting aside of his chair and his _UNK , and a solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially , among the many unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of _UNK almost the only _UNK _UNK of her heavy mind . She did not greatly alter in appearance . The plain dark _UNK , akin to warming _UNK , which she and her child wore , were as neat and as well attended to as a brighter clothes of happy days . She lost her colour , and the old and intent expression was a constant , not an _UNK , thing ; otherwise , she remained very pretty and _UNK . shoul , at night on breathe her father , she would burst into a grief she had domesticated all day , and would say that her sole _UNK , under Heaven , was on him . He always _UNK answered : " Nothing can happen to him without my knowledge , and I know that I can save him , _UNK . " They had not made a round of their changed life many weeks , when her father said to her , on coming home one evening : " My dear , there is an upper window in a prison , to which Charles can sometimes gain _UNK at three in the afternoon . When he can get to _UNK _UNK on many _UNK and _UNK might see you in the street , he thinks , if you stood in a certain place that I can show you . But you will not be able to see him , my poor child , and even if you could , it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition . " " _UNK show me the place , my father , and I will go there every day . " From that time , in all _UNK , she waited there two hours . As the clock struck two , she was there , and at four she turned _UNK away . When it was not too wet or _UNK for her child to be with her , they went together ; at other times she was alone ; but , she never missed the single day . It was a dark and dirty corner of a small winding street . A capable of the _UNK of wood into _UNK for burning , was the only house at that end ; all else was wall . On the third day of her being there , he noticed her . " Good day , _UNK . " " Good day , _UNK . " This mode of address was now prescribed by _UNK . It had been established voluntarily some time ago , among the more thorough _UNK ; but , was now law for everybody . " Walking here again , _UNK ? " " You see me , _UNK ! " A _UNK , who was a little man with a _UNK of gesture ( he had once been the _UNK of roads ) , cast a glance at the prison , pointed at a prison , and putting his ten fingers before his face to the bars , peeped through them _UNK . " But it ' s not my business , " said he . And went on _UNK his wood . heart-broken day he was looking out for her , and accosted her a moment she appeared . " What ? --she here again , _UNK ? " " Yes , _UNK . " " Ah ! The child too ! Your mother , is it not , my little _UNK ? " " Do I say yes , _UNK ? " whispered little _UNK , drawing close to her . " Yes , dearest . " " Yes , _UNK . " " Ah ! But it ' s not my business . My work is my business . See my saw ! I call it my Little _UNK . _UNK , _UNK , _UNK ; _UNK , _UNK , _UNK ! And off his head comes ! " The _UNK fell as he spoke , and he threw it into the basket . " I call myself the _UNK of the _UNK _UNK . See here again ! _UNK , loo , loo ; _UNK , loo , loo ! And off _her_ head comes ! Now , the child . _UNK , _UNK ; _UNK , _UNK ! And off the head comes . All the family ! " _UNK shuddered as he threw two more _UNK into his basket , but it was impossible to be there while the _UNK was at work , and not be in his sight . _UNK , to secure his good will , she always spoke to him first , and often gave him _UNK , which he readily received . He was an _UNK fellow , and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at a prison roof and _UNK , and in lifting her heart up to her husband , she would come to herself to find him looking at her , with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work . " But it ' s not my business ! " he would generally say at those times , and would briskly fall to his _UNK again . In all _UNK , in the snow and _UNK of winter , in a bitter winds of spring , in the hot sunshine of summer , in a _UNK of , , and again in the snow and _UNK of winter , _UNK passed two hours of every day at this place ; and every day on leaving it , she kissed the prison wall . Her husband saw her ( so she learned from her father ) it might be once in five or six times : it might be twice or thrice running : it might be , not for a week or a fortnight together . It was enough that he could and did see her when a chances served , and on that possibility she would have waited out a day , seven days a week . These occupations brought her round to the _UNK month , wherein her father walked among the terrors with the steady head . On a _UNK afternoon she arrived at the usual corner . It was the day of some wild rejoicing , and the _UNK . She had seen the houses , as she came along , decorated with little _UNK , and with little red caps stuck upon them ; also , with _UNK _UNK ; also , with the _UNK inscription ( _UNK letters were the favourite ) , _UNK One and _UNK . _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , or Death ! The miserable shop of the _UNK was so small , that its whole surface furnished very _UNK space for this _UNK . He had got somebody to _UNK it up for him , however , who had squeezed Death in with most _UNK difficulty . On his house-top , he displayed _UNK and cap , as a good _UNK must , and in the window he had stationed his saw _UNK as his " Little _UNK _UNK " --for a great sharp female was by that time _UNK _UNK . His shop was shut and he was not there , which was a relief to _UNK , and left her quite alone . But , he was not far off , for presently she heard a troubled , and the shouting coming along , which filled her with fear . The moment afterwards , and the throng of people came pouring round a corner by a prison wall , in the midst of whom was a _UNK hand in hand with A _UNK . There could not be fewer than five hundred people , and they were dancing like five thousand _UNK . There was no other music than their own singing . They danced to the _UNK _UNK song , keeping a ferocious time that was like a _UNK of teeth in _UNK . Men and women danced together , women danced together , men danced together , as hazard had brought them together . At first , they were a mere _UNK of coarse red caps and coarse terrible rags ; but , as they filled the place , and stopped to _UNK about _UNK , some ghastly apparition of the _UNK gone raving mad arose among them . They advanced , ' , struck at one another ' s hands , clutched at one another ' s heads , _UNK round alone , caught one another and _UNK round in pairs , until many of them dropped . While those were down , the rest a hand in hand , and all _UNK round together : then the ring broke , and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they all stopped at once , began again , struck , clutched , and tore , and then _UNK a _UNK , and all _UNK round another way . Suddenly they stopped again , paused , struck out the time afresh , formed into boasts the width of the public way , and , with their heads low down and their hands high up , _UNK screaming off . No _UNK could have been half so terrible as this _UNK . It was so emphatically the fallen _UNK something , once innocent , delivered over to all _UNK healthy _UNK changed into the means of angering the blood , bewildering the senses , and _UNK the heart . Such grace as was visible in it , made it a _UNK , showing how _UNK and _UNK all things good by nature were become . The _UNK bosom _UNK to this , a pretty _UNK ' s head thus distracted , a delicate foot _UNK in this _UNK of blood and dirt , were _UNK of a disjointed time . This was the _UNK . As it passed , leaving _UNK frightened and bewildered in a doorway of the _UNK ' s house , the _UNK snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft , as if it had never been . " _UNK my father ! " for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she had _UNK darkened with her hand ; " such the cruel , bad sight . " " I know , my dear , I know . I have seen it many times . Don ' t be frightened ! Not one of them would harm you . " " I am not frightened for myself , my father . But when I think of my husband , and the . of these _UNK " " We will set him above their peering very soon . I left him climbing to the window , and I came to tell you . There is no one here to see . You may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof . " " I do so , father , and I send him my _UNK with it ! " " You cannot see him , my poor dear ? " " No , father , " said _UNK , _UNK and weeping as she kissed her hand , " no . " A footstep in the snow . _UNK _UNK . " I _UNK you , _UNK , " from a Doctor . " I _UNK you , _UNK . " This in passing . Nothing more . _UNK _UNK gone , like the shadow over the white road . " Give me your arm , my love . _UNK from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage , for his sake . That was well done ; " they had left the spot ; " it shall not be in vain . Charles is summoned for to-morrow . " " For to-morrow ! " " There is no time to lose . I am well prepared , but there are dignitary to be taken , that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the _UNK . He has not received the notice yet , but I know that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow , and removed to the _UNK ; I have timely information . You are not afraid ? " She could scarcely answer , " I trust in you . " " Do so , implicitly . Your suspense is nearly _UNK , my darling ; he shall be restored to you within a few hours ; I have _UNK him with every protection . I must see _UNK . " He stopped . There was the heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing . They both knew too well what it meant . One . Two . Three . Three _UNK _UNK away with their dread _UNK over the _UNK snow . " I must see _UNK , " the Doctor repeated , turning her another way . The the old gentleman was still in his trust ; had never left it . He and his books were in frequent _UNK as to property confiscated and made _UNK . What he could save for a trinket , he saved . No better man living to hold fast by what _UNK ' s had in keeping , and to hold his peace . A a red and yellow sky , and the rising mist from the _UNK , denoted the approach of darkness . It was almost dark when they arrived at the Bank . The stately residence of _UNK was altogether blighted and deserted . retreating a heap of dust and ashes in a court , ran the letters : _UNK _UNK . _UNK One and _UNK . _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , or Death ! Who could that be with Mr . _UNK owner of the _UNK upon the _UNK must not be seen ? From whom _UNK arrived , did he come out , agitated and surprised , to take his favourite in his arms ? To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words , when , raising his voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued , he said : " _UNK to the _UNK , and summoned for to-morrow ? " _UNK . _UNK A dread _UNK of five haggard , _UNK _UNK , and determined _UNK , sat every day . Their _UNK went forth every evening , and were read out by the _UNK of a various _UNK to their commons . A _UNK _UNK was , " Come out and listen to the _UNK _UNK , you inside there ! " " Charles _UNK , called _UNK ! " So at last began a _UNK _UNK at _UNK _UNK . When the name was called , its owner stepped apart into the spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus _UNK recorded . Charles _UNK , called _UNK , had reason to know the usage ; he had seen hundreds pass away so . His _UNK _UNK , who wore spectacles to read with , glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place , and went through the _UNK , making a similar short pause at each name . There were _UNK names , but only twenty were responded to ; for one of the ' so summoned had died in _UNK and been forgotten , and two had already been _UNK and forgotten . The _UNK was read , in the _UNK chamber where _UNK had seen the nasty a on the night of his arrival . Every one of those had perished in the _UNK ; every human creature he had since _UNK for and parted with , had died on a quill . There were hurried words of farewell and kindness , but the parting was soon over . It was the obscurity of every day , and the society of _UNK _UNK were engaged in the preparation of some _UNK of _UNK and a little _UNK , for that evening . They crowded to a _UNK and shed tears there ; but , twenty places in the _UNK _UNK had to be _UNK , and the time was , at best , short to the _UNK hour , when a common rooms and _UNK would be delivered over to the great dogs who kept watch there through the night . The ' were far from insensible or _UNK ; their ways arose out of the condition of the time . _UNK , though with a subtle difference , a species of fervour or _UNK , known , without doubt , to have led some persons to brave the _UNK _UNK , and to die by it , was not mere _UNK , but a wild _UNK of the wildly shaken public mind . In _UNK of ' , some of us will have a secret _UNK to a _UNK terrible passing inclination to die of it . And all of us have like _UNK hidden in our _UNK , only _UNK circumstances to _UNK them . A passage to the _UNK was short and dark ; the night in its _UNK a was long and cold . heart-broken day , fifteen ' were put to the bar before Charles _UNK ' s name was called . All the fifteen were sign-board , and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half . " Charles _UNK , called _UNK , " was at length _UNK . His overfed sat upon a discreet in _UNK hats ; but a rough red cap and _UNK _UNK was a _UNK otherwise prevailing . Looking at a _UNK and a turbulent audience , he might have thought that the usual order of things was _UNK , and that the felons were trying the honest men . The lowest , _UNK , and worst boundaries of the city , never without its quantity of low , cruel , and bad , were the directing spirits of the scene : noisily _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , , , and _UNK the result , without a offender . Of the men , the greater part were _UNK in various ways ; of the women , some wore _UNK , some _UNK , some ate and drank as they looked on , many _UNK . NANCY these last , was one , with a spare piece of effectual under her arm as she worked . She was in a front row , by the side of the man whom he had never seen since his arrival at the _UNK , but whom he directly remembered as _UNK . He noticed that she once or twice whispered in his ear , and that she seemed to be his wife ; but , what he most noticed in the two figures was , that although they were _UNK as close to himself as they could be , they never looked towards him . They seemed to be waiting for something with the dogged determination , and they looked at the _UNK , but at nothing else . Under the , sat ' _UNK , in his usual quiet dress . As well as the prisoner could see , he and Mr . _UNK were the only men there , _UNK with the _UNK , who wore their usual clothes , and had not assumed a coarse garb of the _UNK . Charles _UNK , called _UNK , was _UNK by the public prosecutor as an _UNK , whose life was _UNK to the _UNK , under the _UNK which _UNK all _UNK on pain of Death . It was nothing that the _UNK bore date since his return to provoke . There he was , and there was a _UNK ; he had been taken in , , and his head was demanded . " Take off his head ! " cried a audience . " An enemy to the _UNK ! " The . rang his bell to silence those cries , and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England ? _UNK it was . Was he not an _UNK then ? What did he call himself ? Not an _UNK , he hoped , within a sense and spirit of the law . Why not ? the lawyers desired to know . Because he had voluntarily , the _UNK that was _UNK to him , and the station that was _UNK to him , and had left his _UNK submitted before the word _UNK in the present _UNK by the _UNK was in _UNK live by his own _UNK in England , rather than on the _UNK of the _UNK people of wheels . What proof had he of this ? He handed in the names of two witnesses ; _UNK _UNK , and _UNK _UNK . But he had married in England ? the the reminded him . _UNK , but not an English woman . The _UNK of the ? Yes . By birth . Her name and family ? " _UNK _UNK , only daughter of ' _UNK , a good _UNK who sits there . " This answer had a happy effect upon a audience . _UNK in _UNK of the well-known good _UNK new the hall . So _UNK were the people moved , that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner the moment before , as if with impatience to . him out into the streets and kill him . On these few steps of his dangerous way , Charles _UNK had set his foot according to Doctor _UNK ' s _UNK instructions . The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him , and had prepared every prudence of his road . The the asked , why had he returned to the when he did , and not sooner ? He had not returned sooner , he replied , simply because he had no means of living in , , save those he had resigned ; _UNK , in England , he lived by giving _UNK in a French _UNK and literature . He had returned when he did , on a pressing and written _UNK of a French _UNK , who represented that his life was endangered by his absence . He had come back , to save the _UNK ' s life , and to bear his testimony , at whatever personal hazard , to the truth . Was that criminal in the eyes of the _UNK ? The ' cried _UNK , " No ! " and the ferocious rang his bell to quiet them . Which it did not , for they continued to cry " No ! " until they left off , of their own will . The the required the name of that _UNK . The _UNK explained that the _UNK was his first witness . He also referred with confidence to the _UNK ' s letter , which had been taken from him at the _UNK , but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the stair-head . The Doctor had taken care that it should be _UNK assured him that it would be _UNK at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read . _UNK _UNK was called to confirm it , and did so . _UNK _UNK neatly , with _UNK _UNK and politeness , that in the pressure of business imposed on the _UNK by the odour of enemies of the _UNK with which it had to deal , he had been slightly overlooked in his prison of the _UNK fact , had rather passed out of a _UNK ' s patriotic _UNK three days ago ; when he had been summoned before it , and had been set at liberty on the _UNK ' s declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered , as to himself , by the _UNK of the _UNK _UNK , called _UNK . vast _UNK was next of . His high personal _UNK , and the _UNK of his _UNK , made a great impression ; but , as he proceeded , as he showed that the _UNK was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment ; that , the _UNK had remained in England , always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their _UNK ; that , so far from being in favour with the _UNK government there , he had actually been tried for his life by it , as a _UNK of England and friend of the _UNK _UNK he brought these circumstances into view , with the greatest _UNK and with a straightforward force of truth and earnestness , a _UNK and the a became one . At last , when he appealed by name to _UNK _UNK , an English gentleman then and there present , who , like himself , had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it , a _UNK declared that they had heard enough , and that they were ready with their _UNK if the senior were content to receive them . At every vote ( the _UNK _UNK aloud and _UNK ) , the a set up a shout of applause . All the voices were in a prisoner ' s favour , and a tea-pot declared him free . Then , began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the ' sometimes gratified their _UNK , or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy , or which they regarded as some _UNK against their swollen account of cruel rage . No man can . now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were _UNK ; it is probable , to the _UNK of all the three , with a second _UNK . No sooner was a _UNK pronounced , than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time , and such _UNK embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both _UNK as could rush at him , that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of to from exhaustion ; none the less because he knew very well , that the very same people , carried by another current , would have rushed at him with the very same intensity , to _UNK him to pieces and strew him over the streets . His , , to make way for other _UNK persons who were to be tried , rescued him from these _UNK for the moment . _UNK were to be tried together , next , as enemies of the _UNK , forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed . So quick was the _UNK to _UNK itself and the _UNK for the chance lost , that these five came down to him before he left the place , bespoke to die within _UNK hours . A first of them told him so , with the customary prison sign of _UNK raised _UNK they all added in words , " Long live the _UNK ! " The five had had , it is true , no audience to lengthen their proceedings , for when he and Doctor _UNK emerged from the gate , there was a great crowd about it , in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in _UNK two , for which he looked in vain . On his coming out , the concourse made at him ' , weeping , embracing , and shouting , all by turns and all together , until the very tide of the river on a bank of which a mad scene was acted , seemed to run mad , like the people on the stair-head . They put him into the great chair they had among them , and which they had taken either out of the _UNK itself , or one of its rooms or passages . _UNK the chair they had thrown a red _UNK , and to the back of it they had bound the _UNK with a red cap on its top . In this _UNK of triumph , not even the Doctor ' s wasn could prevent his being carried to his home on men ' s shoulders , with the confused sea of red caps heaving about him , and casting up to sight from a stormy deep such _UNK of faces , that he more than once _UNK his mind being in confusion , and that he was in a _UNK on his way to the _UNK . In wild _UNK _UNK , embracing whom they met and pointing him out , they carried him on . _UNK the _UNK streets with a weary _UNK colour , in winding and _UNK through them , as they had _UNK them below the snow with a deeper dye , they carried him thus into the _UNK of the building where he lived . Her father had gone on before , to prepare her , and when her husband stood upon his feet , she dropped insensible in his arms . As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd , so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen , a few of the people fell to dancing . _UNK , all the rest fell to dancing , and the _UNK _UNK with the _UNK . Then , they a into the vacant chair the young woman from the crowd to be carried as the _UNK of _UNK , and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets , and along the river ' s bank , and over the bridge , the _UNK absorbed them every one and the them away . After grasping a Doctor ' s hand , as he stood _UNK and proud before him ; after grasping the hand of Mr . _UNK , who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the _UNK of the _UNK ; after ' little _UNK , who was lifted up to undermine her arms round his neck ; and after embracing a ever zealous and faithful _UNK who lifted her ; he took his wife in his arms , and carried her up to their rooms . " _UNK ! My own ! I am safe . " " _UNK dearest Charles , let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to the . " They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts . When she was again in his arms , he said to her : " And now speak to your father , dearest . No other man in all this monstrous could have done what he has done for me . " She laid her head upon her father ' s breast , as she had laid his poor head on her own breast , long , long ago . He was happy in the return he had made her , he was _UNK for his suffering , he was proud of his strength . " You must not be weak , my darling , " he remonstrated ; " don ' t tremble so . I have saved him . " _UNK . A Knock at the _UNK " I have saved him . " It was not another of the _UNK in which he had often come back ; he was really here . And yet his wife trembled , and a vague but heavy fear was upon her . All the air round was so thick and dark , the people were so passionately _UNK and _UNK , the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice , it was so impossible to forget that many as _UNK as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her , every day approached the fate from which he had been clutched , that her heart could not be as _UNK of its load as she felt it ought to be . A shadows of the _UNK afternoon were beginning to fall , and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets . Her mind pursued them , looking for him among the _UNK ; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more . Her father , _UNK her , showed a crow superiority to this woman ' s weakness , which was wonderful to see . No _UNK , no _UNK , no One _UNK and _UNK , North _UNK , now ! He had accomplished the task he had set himself , his promise was redeemed , he had saved Charles . Let them all lean upon him . Their _UNK was of a very _UNK kind : not only because that was the _UNK way of life , involving the least offence to the people , but because they were not rich , and Charles , throughout his imprisonment , had had to pay heavily for his bad food , and for his guard , and towards the living of the poorer ' . _UNK on this account , and partly to avoid the domestic spy , they kept no servant ; a _UNK and _UNK who acted as _UNK at the _UNK gate , rendered them _UNK service ; and _UNK ( almost wholly transferred to them by Mr . _UNK ) had become their daily _UNK , and had his bed there every night . It was an _UNK of the _UNK One and _UNK of _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , or Death , that on the door or _UNK of every house , the name of every _UNK must be _UNK _UNK in letters of a certain size , at a certain convenient height from the ground . Mr . _UNK _UNK ' s name , therefore , duly embellished the _UNK down below ; and , as the afternoon shadows _UNK , the owner of that name himself appeared , from _UNK the _UNK whom Doctor _UNK had employed to add to the _UNK the name of Charles _UNK , called _UNK . In a universal fear and the that darkened the time , all the usual harmless ways of life were changed . In a Doctor ' s little _UNK , as in very many others , the articles of daily _UNK that were wanted were purchased every evening , in small _UNK and at various small shops . To avoid attracting notice , and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and _UNK , was a general desire . For some months past , Miss _UNK and Mr . _UNK had discharged the office of _UNK ; the former carrying the money ; the latter , the basket . Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were lighted , they _UNK forth on this duty , and made and brought home such _UNK as were needful . Although Miss _UNK , through her long _UNK with a French family , might have known as much of their _UNK as of her own , if she had had the mind , she had no mind in that direction ; consequently she knew no more of that " nonsense " ( as she was pleased to call it ) than Mr . _UNK did . So her manner of _UNK was to _UNK a _UNK at the head of a _UNK without any introduction in the nature of an article , and , if it happened not to be the name of a thing she wanted , to look round for that thing , lay hold of it , and hold on by it until a bargain was concluded . She always made a bargain for it , by holding up , as the statement of its just price , one finger less than a merchant held up , whatever his number might be . " Now , Mr . _UNK , " said Miss _UNK , whose eyes were red with felicity ; " if you are ready , I am . " _UNK _UNK _UNK himself at Miss _UNK ' s service . He had worn all his rust off long ago , but nothing would file his _UNK head down . " There ' s all manner of things wanted , " said Miss _UNK , " and we shall have a precious time of it . We want wine , among the rest . _UNK _UNK these _UNK will be drinking , wherever we buy it . " " It will be much the same to your knowledge , miss , I should think , " retorted _UNK , " whether they drink your health or the Old _UNK ' s . " " Who ' s he ? " said Miss _UNK . Mr . _UNK , with some _UNK , explained himself as meaning " Old _UNK ' s . " " Ha ! " said Miss _UNK , " it doesn ' t need an _UNK to explain a meaning of these creatures . They have but one , and it ' s , Murder , and _UNK . " " Hush , dear ! Pray , pray , be cautious ! " cried _UNK . " Yes , yes , yes , I ' ll be cautious , " said Miss _UNK ; " but I may say among ourselves , that I do hope there will be no _UNK and _UNK _UNK in the form of _UNK all round , going on in the streets . Now , _UNK , never you stir from that fire till I come back ! Take care of the dear husband you have recovered , and don ' t move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now , till you see me again ! suspiciously I ask the question , ' _UNK , before I go ? " " I think you may take that liberty , " the Doctor answered , smiling . " For gracious sake , don ' t talk about _UNK ; we have quite enough of that , " said Miss _UNK . " Hush , dear ! Again ? " _UNK remonstrated . " Well , my sweet , " said Miss _UNK , nodding her head emphatically , " a short and a long of it is , that I am the subject of His Most _UNK Majesty King barring the _UNK ; " Miss _UNK _UNK at the name ; " and as such , my maxim is , Confound their _UNK , _UNK their _UNK tricks , On him our hopes we , , God save the King ! " Mr . _UNK , in an _UNK of _UNK , _UNK repeated the words after Miss _UNK , like somebody at church . " I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you , though I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice , " said Miss _UNK , approvingly . " But the question , ' _UNK . Is there " _UNK was a good creature ' s way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all , and to come at it in this chance _UNK " is there any prospect yet , of our getting out of this place ? " " I fear not yet . It would be dangerous for Charles yet . " " _UNK ! " said Miss _UNK , cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling ' s _UNK hair in the light of the fire , " then we must have patience and wait : that ' s all . We must hold up our heads and _UNK low , as my brother _UNK used to say . Now , Mr . _UNK ! _UNK ' t you move , _UNK ! " They went out , leaving _UNK , and her husband , her father , and the child , by the bright fire . Mr . _UNK was expected back presently from the _UNK House . Miss _UNK had lighted the lamp , but had put it aside in a corner , that they might . the _UNK _UNK . Little _UNK sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm : and he , in the tone not rising much above a whisper , began to tell her the story of a great and powerful _UNK who had opened a _UNK and let out the captive who had once done the _UNK the service . All was subdued and quiet , and _UNK was more at ease than she had been . " What is that ? " she cried , all at once . " My dear ! " said her father , stopping in his story , and laying his hand on hers , " command yourself . What a disordered state you are in ! The least _UNK you ! magnificent , your father ' s daughter ! " " I thought , my father , " said _UNK , _UNK herself , with the pale face and in a faltering voice , " that I heard strange feet upon the stairs . " " My love , the staircase is as still as Death . " As he said the word , a blow was struck upon the door . " Oh father , father . What can this be ! _UNK Charles . Shortly him ! " " My child , " said the Doctor , rising , and laying his hand upon her shoulder , " I _have_ saved him . What weakness is this , my dear ! Let me go to the door . " He took the lamp in his hand , crossed the two intervening outer rooms , and opened it . A rude rabbit of feet over the floor , and four rough men in red caps , _UNK with _UNK and pistols , entered the room . " A _UNK _UNK , called _UNK , " said the first . " Who _UNK him ? " answered _UNK . " I seek him . We seek him . I know you , _UNK ; I saw you before the _UNK to-day . You are again the prisoner of the _UNK . " The four surrounded him , where he stood with his wife and child clinging to him . " Tell me how and why am I again the prisoner ? " " It is enough that you return straight to the _UNK , and will know to-morrow . You are summoned for to-morrow . " sees _UNK , whom this visitation had so turned into stone , that he stood with the lamp in his hand , as if he were the _UNK made to hold it , moved after these words were spoken , put the lamp down , and transporting the speaker , and taking him , not _UNK , by the loose front of his red a shirt , said : " You know him , you have said . Do you know me ? " " Yes , I know you , _UNK Doctor . " " We all know you , _UNK ' , " said the other three . He looked abstractedly from one to another , and said , in the lower voice , after a pause : " Will you answer his question to me then ? How does this happen ? " " _UNK ' , " said the first , _UNK , " he has been _UNK to the _UNK of Saint _UNK . This _UNK , " pointing out a second who had entered , " is from Saint _UNK . " The _UNK here indicated nodded his head , and added : " He is _UNK by Saint _UNK . " " Of what ? " asked a Doctor . " _UNK ' , " said the first , with his former reluctance , " ask no more . If the _UNK you _UNK from you , without doubt you as a good _UNK will be happy to make them . A _UNK goes before all . A People is , . _UNK , we are pressed . " " One word , " a Doctor entreated . " Will you tell me who _UNK him ? " " It is against rule , " answered the first ; " but you can ask impetus of Saint _UNK here . " The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man . Who moved uneasily on his feet , rubbed his beard a little , and at length said : " Well ! _UNK it is against rule . But he is _UNK _UNK the _UNK and _UNK _UNK . And by one other . " " What other ? " " Do _you_ ask , _UNK Doctor ? " " Yes . " " Then , " said he of Saint _UNK , with the strange look , " you will be answered to-morrow . Now , I am dumb ! " _UNK . The Hand at _UNK _UNK unconscious of the new calamity at home , Miss _UNK threaded her way along a narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the _UNK , the in her mind the number of _UNK _UNK she had to make . Mr . _UNK , with the basket , walked at her side . They both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed , had the wary eye for all _UNK _UNK of people , and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of _UNK . It was a raw evening , and the misty river , _UNK to the eye with . lights and to the ear with harsh noises , showed where a _UNK were stationed in which the _UNK worked , making _UNK for the _UNK of the _UNK . _UNK to the man who played tricks with , _UNK , or got _UNK promotion in it ! Better for him that his beard had never grown , for the _UNK _UNK shaved him close . Having purchased a few small articles of _UNK , and the measure of _UNK for the lamp , Miss _UNK bethought herself of the wine they wanted . After peeping into several _UNK , she stopped at the sign of a Good _UNK _UNK of _UNK , not far from the _UNK _UNK , once ( and twice ) the _UNK , where the aspect of things rather took her fancy . It had a _UNK look than any other place of the same description they had passed , and , though red with patriotic caps , was not so red as the rest . _UNK Mr . _UNK , and finding him of her opinion , Miss _UNK , to a Good _UNK _UNK of _UNK , attended by her _UNK . _UNK observant of a smoky lights ; of the people , pipe in mouth , playing with _UNK cards and yellow _UNK ; of the one _UNK , _UNK , _UNK workman reading the _UNK aloud , and of the others listening to him ; of the _UNK worn , or laid aside to be resumed ; of the two or three _UNK fallen forward asleep , who in a _UNK a shaggy black _UNK looked , in that attitude , like _UNK bears or dogs ; the two _UNK _UNK approached the counter , and showed what they wanted . As their wine was _UNK out , a man parted from another man in a corner , and rose to depart . In going , he had to face Miss _UNK . No sooner did he face her , than Miss _UNK uttered a scream , and clapped her hands . In a moment , the whole company were on their feet . That somebody was _UNK by somebody _UNK the difference of opinion was a _UNK occurrence . Everybody looked to see somebody fall , but only saw a man and the woman standing staring at each other ; the man with all the . aspect of the _UNK and the thorough _UNK ; the woman , evidently English . What was said in this _UNK _UNK , by the _UNK of a Good _UNK _UNK of _UNK , except that it was something very _UNK and loud , would have been as so much _UNK or _UNK to Miss _UNK and her _UNK , though they had been all ears . But , they had no ears for anything in their surprise . For , it must be recorded , that not only was Miss _UNK lost in amazement and agitation , but , Mr . _UNK it seemed on his own separate and individual _UNK in a state of the greatest wonder . " What is the matter ? " said the man who had caused Miss _UNK to scream ; speaking in the vexed , abrupt voice ( though in a low tone ) , and in English . " Oh , _UNK , dear _UNK ! " cried Miss _UNK , clapping her hands again . " After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time , do I find you here ! " " Don ' t call me _UNK . Do you want to be the death of me ? " asked the man , in the _UNK , frightened way . " ' , brother ! " cried Miss _UNK , bursting into tears . " Have I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such the cruel question ? " " Then hold your _UNK tongue , " said _UNK , " and come out , if you want to speak to me . ninth for your wine , and come out . Who ' s this man ? " Miss _UNK , shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother , said through her tears , " Mr . _UNK . " " Let him come out too , " said _UNK . " the he think me the ghost ? " Apparently , Mr . _UNK did , to judge from his looks . He said not a word , however , and Miss _UNK , _UNK a _UNK of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine . As she did so , _UNK turned to the _UNK of a Good _UNK _UNK of _UNK , and offered a few words of explanation in a French _UNK , which caused them all to _UNK into their former places and pursuits . " Now , " said _UNK , stopping at the dark street corner , " what do you want ? " " How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from ! " cried Miss _UNK , " to give me such a scullery , and show me no affection . " " There . _Non it ! There , " said _UNK , making a _UNK at Miss _UNK ' s lips with his own . " Now are you content ? " Miss _UNK only shook her head and wept in silence . " If you expect me to be surprised , " said her brother _UNK , " I am not surprised ; I knew you were here ; I know of most people who are here . If you really don ' t want to _UNK my _UNK I half believe you _UNK your ways as soon as possible , and let me go mine . I am busy . I am an official . " " My English brother _UNK , " _UNK Miss _UNK , casting up her _UNK eyes , " that had the _UNK in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country , an official among _UNK , and such _UNK ! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in _UNK " " I said so ! " cried her brother , interrupting . " I knew it . You want to be the death of me . I shall be rendered _UNK , by my own sister . Just as I am getting on ! " " The gracious and merciful _UNK forbid ! " cried Miss _UNK . " _UNK rather would I never see you again , dear _UNK , though I have ever loved you truly , and ever shall . Say but one affectionate word to me , and tell me there is nothing angry or _UNK between us , and I will _UNK you no longer . " Good Miss _UNK ! As if the _UNK between them had come of any _UNK of hers . As if Mr . _UNK had not known it for the fact , years ago , in the quiet corner in _UNK , that this precious brother had spent her money and left her ! He was saying the affectionate word , however , with a far more _UNK condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been _UNK ( which is invariably the case , all the world over ) , when Mr . _UNK , touching him on the shoulder , _UNK and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question : " I say ! _UNK I ask the favour ? As to whether your name is John _UNK , or _UNK John ? " The official turned towards him with sudden and . He had not previously uttered a word . " Come ! " said Mr . _UNK . " Speak out , you know . " ( Which , by the way , was more than he could do himself . ) " John _UNK , or _UNK John ? She calls you _UNK , and she must know , being your sister . And _I_ know you ' re John , you know . Which of the two goes first ? And regarding that name of _UNK , likewise . That warn ' t your name over the water . " " What do you mean ? " " Well , I don ' t know all I mean , for I can ' t call to mind what your name was , over the water . " " No ? " " No . But I ' ll swear it was the name of two _UNK . " " Indeed ? " " Yes . Shortly ' other one ' s was one hallowed . I know you . You was a _UNK at the Bailey . What , in the name of the _UNK of _UNK , own father to yourself , was you called at that time ? " " _UNK , " said another voice , striking in . " That ' s the name for the thousand pound ! " cried _UNK . The speaker who struck in , was _UNK _UNK . He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his _UNK , and he stood at Mr . _UNK ' s elbow as negligently as he might have stood at a Old Bailey itself . " Don ' t be alarmed , my dear Miss _UNK . I arrived at Mr . _UNK ' s , to his surprise , yesterday evening ; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well , or unless I could be useful ; I present myself here , to beg a little talk with your brother . I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr . _UNK . I wish for your sake Mr . _UNK was not the _UNK of the _UNK . " _UNK was a cant word of the time for the spy , under the _UNK . The spy , who was pale , turned _UNK , and asked him how he _UNK " I ' ll tell you , " said _UNK . " I lighted on you , Mr . _UNK , coming out of a prison of the _UNK while I was transporting the walls , an hour or more ago . You have the face to be remembered , and I remember faces well . _UNK curious by seeing you in that connection , and having a reason , to which you are no stranger , for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very suppression , I walked in your direction . I walked into the _UNK here , close after you , and sat near you . I had no difficulty in _UNK from your _UNK conversation , and a rumour openly going about among your admirers , the nature of your calling . And gradually , what I had done at _UNK , seemed to shape itself into the purpose , Mr . _UNK . " " What purpose ? " the spy asked . " It would be troublesome , and might be dangerous , to explain in the street . Could you favour me , in confidence , with some minutes of your _UNK the office of _UNK ' s Bank , for instance ? " " Under the threat ? " " Oh ! Did I say that ? " " Then , why should I go there ? " " ' , Mr . _UNK , I can ' t say , if you can ' t . " " Do you mean that you won ' t say , sir ? " the spy _UNK asked . " You apprehend me very clearly , Mr . _UNK . I won ' t . " _UNK ' s _UNK recklessness of manner came _UNK in aid of his _UNK and skill , in such the business as he had in his secret mind , and with such a man as he had to do with . His _UNK eye saw it , and made a most of it . " Now , I told you so , " said the spy , casting a _UNK look at his sister ; " if any trouble comes of this , it ' s your doing . " " Come , come , Mr . _UNK ! " exclaimed _UNK . " Don ' t be ungrateful . But for my great respect for your sister , I might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual satisfaction . Do you go with me to the Bank ? " " I ' ll hear what you have got to say . Yes , I ' ll go with you . " " I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street . Let me take your arm , Miss _UNK . This is not the good city , at this time , for you to be out in , unprotected ; and as your _UNK knows Mr . _UNK , I will _UNK him to Mr . _UNK ' s with us . Are we ready ? Come then ! " Miss _UNK recalled soon afterwards , and to the end of her life remembered , that as she pressed her hands on _UNK ' s arm and looked up in his face , imploring him to do no hurt to _UNK , there was the _UNK purpose in the arm and a kind of _UNK in the eyes , which not only _UNK his light manner , but changed and raised the man . She was too much occupied then with fears for a brother who so little a her affection , and with _UNK ' s friendly _UNK , _UNK to heed what she observed . They left her at the corner of the street , and _UNK led the way to Mr . _UNK ' s , which was within a few minutes ' walk . John _UNK , or _UNK _UNK , walked at his side . Mr . _UNK had just finished his dinner , and was sitting before a _UNK little _UNK or two of _UNK looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from _UNK ' s , who had looked into a red coals at the _UNK ballad at _UNK , now a good many years ago . He turned his head as they entered , and showed the surprise with which he saw the stranger . " Miss _UNK ' s brother , sir , " said _UNK . " Mr . _UNK . " " _UNK ? " repeated the old gentleman , " _UNK ? I have an _UNK with a _UNK with the face . " " I told you you had a remarkable face , Mr . _UNK , " observed _UNK , coolly . " Pray sit down . " As he took a chair himself , he supplied the _UNK that Mr . _UNK wanted , by saying to him with the _UNK , " reposing at that trial . " Mr . _UNK immediately remembered , and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of Mr . " Mr . _UNK has been recognised by Miss _UNK as the affectionate brother you have heard of , " said _UNK , " and has acknowledged a relationship . I pass to worse news . _UNK has been _UNK again . " chime with _UNK , the old gentleman exclaimed , " What do you tell me ! I left him safe and free within these two hours , and am about to return to him ! " " _UNK for all that . When was it done , Mr . _UNK ? " " Just now , if at all . " " Mr . _UNK is the best authority possible , sir , " said _UNK , " and I have it from Mr . _UNK ' s communication to a friend and brother _UNK over a bottle of wine , that the _UNK has taken place . He left a _UNK at the gate , and saw them admitted by the porter . There is no earthly doubt that he is _UNK . " Mr . _UNK ' s business eye read in the speaker ' s face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point . _UNK , but _UNK that something might depend on his presence of mind , he commanded himself , and was _UNK attentive . " Now , I trust , " said _UNK to him , " that the name and influence of Doctor _UNK may stand him in as good _UNK _UNK said he would be before the _UNK again to-morrow , Mr . _UNK ? -- " " Yes ; I believe so . " " --In as good _UNK to-morrow as to-day . But it may not be so . I own to you , I am shaken , Mr . _UNK , by Doctor _UNK ' s not having had the power to prevent this _UNK . " " He may not have known of it _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK . " But that very circumstance would be alarming , when we remember how ' he is with his _UNK . " " That ' s true , " Mr . _UNK acknowledged , with his troubled hand at his chin , and his troubled eyes on _UNK . " In short , " said _UNK , " this is a desperate time , when desperate _UNK are played for desperate _UNK . Let a Doctor play a _UNK game ; I will play a losing one . No man ' s life here is worth purchase . mere one carried home by the people to-day , may be . tomorrow . Now , the stake I have resolved to play for , in case of the worst , is a friend in the _UNK . And a friend I purpose to myself to win , is Mr . _UNK . " " You need have good cards , sir , " said the spy . " I ' ll run them over . I ' ll see what I hold , _UNK . _UNK , you know what a brute I am ; I wish you ' d give me a little brandy . " It was put before him , and he drank off the _UNK off another _UNK a bottle successive away . " Mr . _UNK , " he went on , in the tone of one who really was looking over the hand at cards : " _UNK of the _UNK , _UNK of _UNK _UNK , now scent , now prisoner , always winding and secret courts , so much a more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of _UNK in those characters than the _UNK , _UNK himself to his _UNK under the _UNK name . That ' s the very good card . Mr . _UNK , now in the employ of a _UNK French government , was formerly in the employ of the _UNK English government , the enemy of , and freedom . That ' s an excellent card . _UNK clear as day in this region of suspicion , that Mr . _UNK , still in the pay of the _UNK English government , is the spy of _UNK , a treacherous _UNK of the _UNK crouching in its bosom , the English _UNK and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find . That ' s the card not to be beaten . Have you followed my hand , Mr . _UNK ? " " Not to understand your play , " returned the spy , somewhat uneasily . " I play my _UNK , _UNK of Mr . _UNK to the nearest _UNK _UNK . Look over your hand , Mr . _UNK , and see what you have . Don ' t hurry . " He drew a bottle near , poured out another glassful of brandy , and drank it off . He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate _UNK of him . Seeing it , he poured out and drank another glassful . " Look over your hand carefully , Mr . _UNK . Take time . " It was the poorer hand than he suspected . Mr . _UNK saw losing cards in it that _UNK _UNK knew nothing of . _UNK out of his honourable employment in England , through too much a hard _UNK _UNK because he was not wanted there ; our English reasons for _UNK our superiority to secrecy and _UNK are of very modern _UNK knew that he had crossed the _UNK , and _UNK service in the : first , as a _UNK and an _UNK among his own verdict there : gradually , as a _UNK and an _UNK among the _UNK . He knew that under the _UNK government he had been the spy upon Saint _UNK and _UNK ' s _UNK ; had received from the _UNK police such heads of information concerning ' _UNK ' s imprisonment , Esquire , and history , as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the _UNK ; and tried them on _UNK _UNK , and had broken down with them _UNK . He always remembered with fear and trembling , that that terrible woman had _UNK when he talked with her , and had looked _UNK at him as her fingers moved . He had since seen her , in a _UNK of Saint _UNK , over and over again produce her _UNK _UNK , and _UNK people whose lives a _UNK then surely swallowed up . He knew , as every one employed as he was did , that he was never safe ; that flight was impossible ; that he was tied fast under the shadow of a _UNK ; and that in spite of his utmost _UNK and treachery in _UNK of the _UNK terror , a word might bring it down upon him . Once _UNK , and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind , he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose , character he had seen many proofs , would produce against him that fatal register , and would _UNK his last chance of life . Besides that all secret men are men soon terrified , here were surely cards enough of one black suit , to justify the _UNK in growing rather livid as he turned them over . " You scarcely seem to like your hand , " said _UNK , with the greatest computation . " Do you play ? " " I think , sir , " said the spy , in the meanest manner , as he turned to Mr . _UNK , " I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence , to put it to this other gentleman , so much your courts , whether he can under any circumstances _UNK it to his station to play that _UNK of which he has spoken . I admit that _I_ am the spy , and that it is considered the _UNK _UNK it must be filled by somebody ; but this gentleman is no spy , and why should he so _UNK himself as to make himself one ? " " I play my _UNK , Mr . _UNK , " said _UNK , taking a answer on himself , and looking at his watch , " without any scruple , in a very few minutes . " " I should have hoped , gentlemen both , " said the spy , always striving to hook Mr . _UNK into the discussion , " that your respect for my _UNK " " I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother , " said _UNK _UNK . " You think not , sir ? " " I have thoroughly made up my mind about it . " The _UNK manner of the spy , _UNK in _UNK with his a rough dress , and probably with his usual demeanour , received such the check from the _UNK of _UNK , _UNK was a mystery to wiser and _UNK men than he , --that it faltered here and failed him . While he was at a loss , _UNK said , resuming his former air of the cards : " And indeed , now I think again , I have a strong impression that I have another good card here , not yet _UNK . That friend and _UNK , who spoke of himself as _UNK in the country _UNK ; who was he ? " " French . You don ' t know him , " said the spy , quickly . " French , eh ? " repeated _UNK , musing , and not appearing to notice him at all , though he echoed his word . " Well ; he may be . " " Is , I assure you , " said the spy ; " though it ' s not important . " " Though it ' s not important , " repeated _UNK , in the same _UNK _UNK " though it ' s not _UNK , it ' s not important . No . _UNK I know the face . " " I think not . I am sure not . It can ' t be , " said the spy . " _UNK ' _UNK , " muttered _UNK _UNK , _UNK , and _UNK his glass ( which fortunately was a small one ) again . " Can ' _UNK . _UNK good French . _UNK like the _UNK , I thought ? " " _UNK , " said the spy . " No . _UNK ! " cried _UNK , striking his open hand on the table , as the light broke clearly on his mind . " _UNK ! _UNK , but the same man . We had that man before us at the Old Bailey . " " Now , there you are hasty , sir , " said _UNK , with a smile that gave his _UNK nose an extra inclination to one side ; " there you really give me an advantage over you . _UNK ( who I will ' admit , at this distance of time , was the partner of mine ) has been dead several years . I attended him in his last illness . He was buried in London , at the church of Saint _UNK . His _UNK with a _UNK quarter-sessions at a moment prevented my following his remains , but I helped to lay him in his coffin . " Here , Mr . _UNK became aware , from where he sat , of the most remarkable dart shadow on the wall . _UNK it to its source , he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and the of all the risen and stiff hair on Mr . _UNK ' s head . " Let us be reasonable , " said the spy , " and let us be fair . To show you how mistaken you are , and what an _UNK assumption yours is , I will lay before you the _UNK of _UNK ' s burial , which I happened to have carried in my pocket-book , " with a hurried hand he produced and opened it , " ever since . There it is . Oh , look at it , look at it ! You may take it in your hand ; it ' s no _UNK . " Here , Mr . _UNK perceived a reflection on the wall to _UNK , and Mr . _UNK rose and stepped forward . His hair could not have been more violently on end , if it had been that moment dressed by the _UNK with the _UNK to in the house that Jack built . _UNK by the spy , Mr . _UNK stood at his side , and touched him on the shoulder like a _UNK _UNK . " That there _UNK _UNK , master , " said Mr . _UNK , with a _UNK and _UNK _UNK . " So _you_ put him in his coffin ? " " I did . " " Who took him out of it ? " _UNK leaned back in his chair , and stammered , " What do you mean ? " " I mean , " said Mr . _UNK , " that he warn ' t never in it . No ! Not he ! I ' ll have my head took off , if he was ever in it . " The spy looked round at the two gentlemen ; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at _UNK . " I tell you , " said _UNK , " that you buried _UNK and earth in that there coffin . Don ' t go and tell me that you buried _UNK . It was the take in . Me and two more knows it . " " How do you know it ? " " What ' s that to you ? Ecod ! " growled Mr . _UNK , " it ' s you I have got the old _UNK again , is it , with your _UNK _UNK upon _UNK ! I ' d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half the _UNK . " _UNK _UNK , who , with Mr . _UNK , had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business , here requested Mr . _UNK to moderate and explain himself . " At another time , sir , " he returned , ' , " the present time is _UNK for _UNK ' . What I stand to , is , that he knows well wot that there _UNK was never in that there coffin . Let him say he was , in so much as the word of one syllable , and I ' ll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half the _UNK ; " Mr . _UNK _UNK upon this as quite a liberal offer ; " or I ' ll out and announce him . " " Humph ! I see one thing , " said _UNK . " I hold another card , Mr . _UNK . _UNK , here in ' , , with _UNK filling the air , for you to _UNK _UNK , when you are in communication with another _UNK spy of the same _UNK as yourself , who , moreover , has the mystery about him of having _UNK death and come to life again ! A plot in the _UNK , of the _UNK against the _UNK . The strong _UNK certain _UNK card ! Do you play ? " " No ! " returned the spy . " I throw up . I confess that we were so _UNK with the outrageous mob , that I only got away from England at a risk of being ducked to death , and that _UNK was so _UNK up and down , that he never would have got away at all but for that sham . Though how this man knows it was a sham , is the wonder of _UNK to me . " " Never you trouble your head about this man , " retorted the _UNK Mr . _UNK ; " you ' ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman . And look here ! Once more ! " _UNK . _UNK could not be restrained from making rather an _UNK _UNK of his _UNK " I ' d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half the _UNK . " The _UNK of the _UNK turned from him to _UNK _UNK , and said , with more decision , " It has come to the point . I go on duty soon , and can ' t _UNK my time . You told me you had a proposal ; what is it ? Now , it is of no use asking too much of me . _UNK me to do anything in my office , putting my head in great extra danger , and I had better trust my life to the chances of the refusal than the chances of consent . In short , I should make that choice . You talk of desperation . We are all desperate here . . ! I may _UNK you if I think proper , and I can swear my way through stone walls , and so can others . Now , what do you want with me ? " " Not very much . You are a ivy at the _UNK ? " " I tell you once for all , there is no such thing as an escape possible , " said the spy , firmly . " Why need you tell me what I have not asked ? You are a ivy at the _UNK ? " " I am sometimes . " " You can be when you choose ? " " I can pass in and out when I choose . " _UNK _UNK filled another glass with brandy , poured it slowly out upon the hearth , and watched it as it dropped . It being all spent , he said , rising : " So far , we have spoken before these two , because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest _UNK between you and me . Come into the dark room here , and let us have one final word alone . " _UNK . A _UNK _UNK While _UNK _UNK and the _UNK of a _UNK were in the adjoining dark room , speaking so low that not the sound was heard , Mr . _UNK looked at _UNK in considerable doubt and self-assured . That honest tradesman ' s manner of receiving a look , did not _UNK confidence ; he changed a leg on which he rested , as often as if he had fifty of those limbs , and were trying them all ; he examined his _UNK with the very _UNK closeness of attention ; and whenever Mr . _UNK ' s eye caught his , he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough _UNK the hollow of the hand before it , which is seldom , if ever , known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character . " _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK . " Come here . " Mr . _UNK came forward sideways , with one of his shoulders in advance of him . " What have you been , besides the messenger ? " After some _UNK , accompanied with an intent look at his patron , Mr . _UNK conceived the _UNK idea of replying , " _UNK character . " " My mind _UNK me much , " said Mr . _UNK , angrily shaking the forefinger at him , " that you have used a respectable and great house of _UNK ' s as a blind , and that you have had an ' occupation of an infamous description . If you have , don ' t expect me to _UNK you when you get back to goblin . If you have , don ' t expect me to keep your secret . _UNK ' s shall not be imposed upon . " " I hope , sir , " _UNK the _UNK Mr . _UNK , " that a gentleman like yourself wot I ' ve had the honour of odd _UNK till I ' m ' at it , would think twice about _UNK of me , even if it _UNK so--I don ' t say it is , but even if it _UNK . And which it is to be took into account that if it _UNK , it wouldn ' t , even then , be all o ' one side . There ' d be two sides to it . There might be medical doctors at the present hour , the picking up their guineas where the honest tradesman don ' t pick up his _UNK ! no , nor yet his half _UNK _UNK ! no , nor yet his _UNK _UNK away like smoke at _UNK ' s , and a _UNK their medical eyes at that tradesman on a sly , a going in and going out to their own _UNK ! equally like smoke , if not more so . Well , that ' Call be imposing , too , on _UNK ' s . For you cannot _UNK a _UNK and not the _UNK . And here ' s Mrs . _UNK , or leastways _UNK in the Old England times , and would be to-morrow , if cause given , the _UNK ' again the business to that degree as is _UNK _UNK ! black them medical professionally ' wives don ' t _UNK ' em at it ! Or , if they _UNK , their _UNK goes in favour of more _UNK , and how can you rightly have one without t ' other ? Then , wot with _UNK , and wot with parish _UNK , and wot with _UNK , and wot with private _UNK ( all _UNK and all in it ) , the man wouldn ' t get much by it , even if it _UNK so . And wot little a man did get , would never prosper with him , Mr . _UNK . He ' d never have no good of it ; he ' d want all along to be out of the line , if he , could see his way out , being once _UNK if it _UNK so . " " Ugh ! " cried Mr . _UNK , rather . , nevertheless , " I am shocked at the sight of you . " " Now , what I would humbly offer to you , sir , " pursued Mr . _UNK , " even if it _UNK so , which I don ' t say it _UNK " " Don ' t _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK . " No , I will _not_ , sir , " returned Mr . _UNK as if nothing were further from his thoughts or _UNK " which I don ' t say it _UNK I would humbly offer to you , sir , would be this . Upon that there stool , at that there Bar , sets that there boy of mine , brought up and _UNK up to be the man , wot will errand you , message you , _UNK you , till your heels is where your head is , if such should be your wishes . If it _UNK so , which I still don ' t say it is ( for I will not _UNK to you , sir ) , let that there boy keep his father ' s place , and take care of his mother ; don ' t blow upon that boy ' s _UNK not do it , _UNK let that father go into a line of a _UNK ' _UNK _UNK ' , and make _UNK for what he would have _UNK it _UNK _UNK _UNK ' of ' em in with the will , and with _UNK _UNK ' the _UNK ' _UNK ' of ' em safe . That , Mr . _UNK , " said Mr . _UNK , wiping his forehead with his arm , as an _UNK that he had arrived at a _UNK of his discourse , " is wot I would respectfully offer to you , sir . A man don ' t see all this here the _UNK ' on dreadful round him , in the way of _UNK without heads , dear me , _UNK enough fur to bring a price down to _UNK and hardly that , without _UNK ' his serious thoughts of things . And these here would be mine , if it _UNK so , _UNK ' of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now , I up and said in the good cause when I might have ? ' it back . " " That at least is true , " said Mr . _UNK . " Say no more now . It may be that I shall yet stand your friend , if you deserve it , and repent in _UNK in words . I want no more words . " Mr . _UNK _UNK his forehead , as _UNK _UNK and the spy returned from the dark room . " _UNK , Mr . _UNK , " said the former ; " our arrangement thus made , you have nothing to fear from me . " He sat down in a chair on the hearth , over against Mr . _UNK . When they were alone , Mr . _UNK asked him what he had done ? " Not much . If it should go ill with the prisoner , I have _UNK _UNK to him , once . " Mr . _UNK ' s countenance fell . " It is all I could do , " said _UNK . " To propose too much , would be to put this man ' s head under the _UNK , and , as he himself said , nothing worse could happen to him if he were _UNK . It was obviously a weakness of the position . There is no help for it . " " But _UNK to him , " said Mr . _UNK , " if it should go ill before the _UNK , will not save him . " " I never said it would . " Mr . _UNK ' s eyes gradually sought the fire ; his sympathy with his darling , and a heavy disappointment of his second _UNK , gradually weakened them ; he was an old man now , the with anxiety of late , and his tears fell . " You are a good man and the true friend , " said _UNK , in an altered voice . " Forgive me if I notice that you are affected . I could not see my father weep , and sit by , careless . And I could not respect your sorrow more , if you were my father . You are free from that misfortune , however . " Though he said the last words , with a blame into his usual manner , there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch , that Mr . _UNK , who had never seen the better side of him , was wholly _UNK for . He gave him his hand , and _UNK gently pressed it . " To return to poor _UNK , " said _UNK . " Don ' t tell Her of this interview , or this arrangement . It would not enable Her to go to see him . She might think it was contrived , in case of the worse , to convey to him a means of , a sentence . " Mr . _UNK had not thought of that , and he looked quickly at _UNK to see if it were in his mind . It seemed to be ; he returned a look , and evidently understood it . " She might think the thousand things , " _UNK said , " and any of them would only add to her trouble . Don ' t speak of me to her . As I said to you when I first came , I had better not see her . I can put my hand out , to do any little _UNK work for her that my hand can find to do , without that . You are going to her , I hope ? She must be very desolate to-night . " " I am going now , directly . " " I am glad of that . She has such a strong attachment to you and _UNK on you . How does she look ? " " _UNK and unhappy , but very beautiful . " " Ah ! " It was a long , grieving sound , like the _UNK like a sob . It attracted Mr . _UNK ' s eyes to _UNK ' s face , which was turned to the fire . A light , or the shade ( the old gentleman could not have said which ) , passed from it as swiftly as the change will sweep over the _UNK on the wild bright day , and he lifted his foot to put back one of a little _UNK _UNK , which was justly forward . He wore a white _UNK and top-boots , then in _UNK , and the light of the fire touching their light _UNK made him look very pale , with his long brown hair , all _UNK , hanging loose about him . His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to bidding a word of remonstrance from Mr . _UNK ; his boot was still upon the hot _UNK of the _UNK _UNK , when it had broken under the weight of his foot . " I forgot it , " he said . Mr . _UNK ' s eyes were again attracted to his face . Shortly note of a wasted air which _UNK the naturally handsome features , and having the expression of ' ' faces fresh in his mind , he was strongly reminded of that expression . " And your duties here have drawn to an end , sir ? " said _UNK , turning to him . " Yes . As I was telling you last night when _UNK came in so unexpectedly , I have at length done all that I can do here . I hoped to have left them in perfect safety , and then to have quitted the . I have my _UNK to _UNK . I was ready to go . " They were both silent . " Yours is a long life to look back upon , sir ? " said _UNK , compassionately . " I am in my _UNK year . " " You have been useful all your life ; steadily and constantly occupied ; trusted , respected , and looked up to ? " " I have been a man of business , ever since I have been the man . Indeed , I may say that I was a man of business when the boy . " " See what the place you fill at _UNK . How many people will miss you when you leave it empty ! " " A solitary old bachelor , " answered Mr . _UNK , shaking his head . " There is nobody to weep for me . " " How can you say that ? Wouldn ' t She weep for you ? Wouldn ' t her child ? " " Yes , yes , thank God . I didn ' t quite mean what I said . " " It _is_ a thing to thank God for ; is it not ? " " Surely , surely . " " If you could say , with truth , to your own solitary heart , to-night , ' I have secured to myself the love and attachment , a gratitude or respect , of no human creature ; I have won myself the tender place in no regard ; I have done nothing good or _UNK to be remembered by ! ' your _UNK years would be _UNK heavy curses ; would they not ? " " You say leathers , Mr . _UNK ; I think they would be . " _UNK turned his eyes again upon the fire , and , after the silence of a few moments , said : " I should like to ask you : _UNK your childhood seem far off ? Do the days when you sat at your mother ' s knee , seem days of very long ago ? " _UNK to his softened manner , Mr . _UNK answered : " Twenty years back , yes ; at this time of my life , no . For , as I draw closer and closer to the end , I travel in the circle , nearer and nearer to the beginning . It seems to be one of a kind _UNK and _UNK of the way . My heart is touched now , by many remembrances that had long fallen asleep , of my pretty young mother ( and I so old ! ) , and by many liberality of the days when what we call the airs was not so real with me , and my faults were not confirmed in me . " " I understand a feeling ! " exclaimed _UNK , with a bright flush . " And you are a better for it ? " " I hope so . " _UNK terminated the conversation here , by rising to help him on with his outer coat ; " But you , " said Mr . _UNK , _UNK to a theme , " you are young . " " Yes , " said _UNK . " I am not old , but my young way was never the way to age . _UNK of me . " " And of me , I am sure , " said Mr . _UNK . " Are you going out ? " " I ' ll walk with you to her gate . You know my vagabond and , habits . If I should _UNK about the streets a long time , don ' t be uneasy ; I shall _UNK in the morning . You go to the _UNK to-morrow ? " " Yes , _UNK . " " I shall be there , but only as one of the crowd . My _UNK will find a place for me . Take my arm , sir . " Mr . _UNK did so , and they went _UNK and out in the streets . A few minutes brought them to Mr . _UNK ' s destination . _UNK left him there ; but lingered at a little distance , and turned back to the gate again when it was shut , and touched it . He had heard of her going to a prison every day . " She came out here , " he said , looking about him , " turned this way , must have trod on these ' often . Let me follow in her steps . " It was ten o ' clock at night when he stood before a prison of _UNK _UNK , where she had stood hundreds of times . The little _UNK , having closed his shop , was smoking his pipe at his shop-door . " Good night , _UNK , " said _UNK _UNK , pausing in going by ; for , a man eyed him _UNK . " Good night , _UNK . " " How goes the _UNK ? " " You mean the _UNK . Not ill . _UNK to-day . We shall _UNK to a hundred soon . _UNK and his men . sometimes , of being exhausted . Ha , ha , ha ! He is so droll , that _UNK . Such a _UNK ! " " Do you often go to see him-- " " _UNK ? gloomy . Every day . What a treaty ! You have seen him at work ? " " Never . " " Go and see him when he has a good _UNK . _UNK this to yourself , _UNK ; he shaved the _UNK to-day , in less than two pipes ! _UNK than two pipes . _UNK of honour ! " As the grinning little man held out a pipe he was smoking , to explain how he _UNK the _UNK , _UNK was so _UNK of the rising desire to strike the life out of him , that he turned away . " But you are not English , " said the _UNK , " though you wear English dress ? " " Yes , " said _UNK , pausing again , and answering over his shoulder . " You speak like a _UNK . " " I am an old _UNK here . " " Aha , a perfect _UNK ! Good night , Englishman . " " Good night , _UNK . " " But go and see that droll dog , " a little man ' , calling after him . " And take the pipe with you ! " _UNK had not gone far out of sight , when he stopped in the middle of the street under a glimmering lamp , and wrote with his _UNK on the scrap of paper . Then , _UNK with a decided step of one who remembered the way well , several dark and dirty _UNK dirtier than usual , for the best public _UNK remained _UNK in those times of _UNK stopped at the _UNK ' s shop , which the owner was closing with his own hands . The small , dim , _UNK shop , kept in the _UNK , _UNK thoroughfare , by a small , dim , _UNK man . _UNK this _UNK , too , good night , as he confronted him at his counter , he laid the scrap of paper before him . " I-- ! " a _UNK whistled softly , as he read it . " _UNK ! Death ! sitiwation ! " _UNK _UNK took no heed , and the _UNK said : " For you , _UNK ? " " For me . " " You will be careful to keep them separate , _UNK ? You know the consequences of mixing them ? " " _UNK . " Maylie--bless small _UNK were made and given to him . He put them , one by one , in a breast of his , coat , counted out the money for them , and deliberately left the shop . " There is nothing more to do , " said he , glancing upward at the moon , " until to-morrow . I can ' t sleep . " It was not the reckless manner , the manner in which he said these words aloud under the _UNK clouds , nor was it more expressive of _UNK than defiance . It was a settled manner of the tired man , who had wandered and struggled and got lost , but who at length struck into his road and saw its end . cabin-boy ago , when he had been less--less among his _UNK _UNK as a youth of great promise , he had followed his father to the grave . His mother had died , years before . These solemn words , which had been read at his father ' s grave , arose in his mind as he went down the dark streets , among a heavy shadows , with a moon and the clouds _UNK on high above him . " I am the _UNK and the life , _UNK a Lord : he that _UNK in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : and _UNK _UNK and _UNK in me , shall never die . " In the city _UNK by the _UNK , alone at night , with natural sorrow rising in him for the _UNK who had been that day put to death , and for to-morrow ' s victims then awaiting their doom in the _UNK , and still of to-morrow ' s and to-morrow ' s , the chain of _UNK that brought the words home , like the rusty old _UNK ' s _UNK from a deep , might have been easily found . He did not seek it , but repeated them and went on . With the solemn interest in a lighted windows where the people were going to rest , _UNK through a few calm hours of the the surrounding them ; in the _UNK of a duel , where no prayers were said , for the _UNK revulsion had even in that length of _UNK from years of _UNK _UNK , _UNK , and _UNK ; in a distant _UNK , reserved , as they wrote upon the gates , for _UNK _UNK ; in the _UNK _UNK ; and in the streets along which the _UNK rolled to the death which had become so common and material , that no sorrowful story of the _UNK _UNK ever arose among the people out of all a working of a _UNK ; with the solemn interest in the whole life and death of the city _UNK down to its short nightly pause in fury ; _UNK _UNK crossed the _UNK again for a lighter streets . _UNK coaches were abroad , for _UNK in coaches were liable to be suspected , and _UNK hid its head in red _UNK , and put on heavy shoes , and trudged . But , a _UNK were all well filled , and the people poured cheerfully out as he passed , and went _UNK home . At one of the theatre doors , there was the little girl with a mother , looking for the way across the street through the mud . He carried a child over , and before the timid arm was _UNK from his neck asked her for a kiss . " I am the _UNK and the life , _UNK a Lord : he that _UNK in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : and _UNK _UNK and _UNK in me , shall never die . " Now , that the streets were quiet , and the night wore on , the words were in the _UNK of his feet , and were in the air . _UNK calm and steady , he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked ; but , he heard them always . The night wore out , and , as he stood upon the bridge listening to the water as it _UNK the _UNK of the House of , , where the _UNK confusion of houses and ' shone bright in the light of the moon , the day came coldly , looking like the dead face out of the sky . Then , the night , with a moon and the stars , turned pale and died , and for a little while it seemed as if _UNK were delivered over to Death ' s _UNK . But , the . sun , rising , seemed to strike those words , that burden of the night , straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays . And looking along them , with reverently _UNK eyes , the bridge of light appeared to _UNK the air between him and the sun , while the river _UNK under it . The strong tide , so produced , so deep , and certain , was like a _UNK friend , in the morning stillness . He walked by the stream , far from the houses , and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on a bank . When he awoke and was _UNK again , he lingered there yet a little longer , watching an _UNK that turned and turned _UNK , until the stream absorbed it , and carried it on to the sea . -- " Like me . " A _UNK , with the _UNK of the softened colour of a dead leaf , then glided into his view , _UNK by him , and died away . As its silent track in the water disappeared , the prayer that had broken up out of his heart for the merciful consideration of all his poor _UNK and , , _UNK in the words , " I am the _UNK and the life . " Mr . _UNK was already out when he got back , and it was easy to _UNK where the good old man was gone . _UNK _UNK drank nothing but the little coffee , ate some bread , and , having washed and changed to _UNK himself , went out to the place of trial . The court was all _UNK and _UNK , when a black _UNK many fell away from in _UNK him into an obscure corner among the crowd . Mr . _UNK was there , and ' _UNK was there . She was there , sitting beside her father . When her husband was brought in , she turned a look upon him , so _UNK , so encouraging , so full of admiring love and _UNK tenderness , yet so _UNK for his sake , that it called a healthy blood into his face , brightened his glance , and animated his heart . If there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look , on _UNK _UNK , it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly . Before that unjust _UNK , there was little or no order of _UNK , _UNK to any _UNK person any reasonable hearing . There could have been no such _UNK , if all laws , forms , and ceremonies , had not first been so _UNK abused , that the _UNK mask of the _UNK was to _UNK them all to a winds . Every eye was turned to a jury . The same determined _UNK and good _UNK as yesterday and the day before , and to-morrow and the day after . _UNK and _UNK among them , one man with a _UNK face , and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips , whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators . A _UNK , _UNK , _UNK juryman , the _UNK Three of St . _UNK . The whole jury , as a jury of dogs _UNK to try the _UNK . Every eye then turned to a five judges and the public prosecutor . No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day . A fell , _UNK , murderous _UNK there . Every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd , and gleamed at it approvingly ; and heads nodded at one another , before bending forward with the the attention . Charles _UNK , called _UNK . _UNK yesterday . _UNK and _UNK yesterday . _UNK delivered to him last night . _UNK and _UNK enemy of the _UNK , _UNK , one of the family of _UNK , one of the race _UNK , for that they had used their _UNK nimble to the infamous _UNK of the people . Charles _UNK , called _UNK , in right of such _UNK , _UNK contemptuous in _UNK . To this effect , in as few or fewer words , the _UNK _UNK . The . asked , was a _UNK openly _UNK or Regular ? " _UNK , uninhabited . " " By whom ? " " Three voices . _UNK _UNK , _UNK of St . _UNK . " " Good . " " _UNK _UNK , his wife . " " Good . " " _UNK _UNK , _UNK . " A great _UNK took place in a court , and in the midst of it , ' _UNK was seen , pale and trembling , standing where he had been seated . " the , I a-talking _UNK to you that this is a _UNK and the stair-head . You know a _UNK to be the husband of my daughter . My daughter , and those dear to her , are far _UNK to me than my life . Who and where is the _UNK _UNK who says that I _UNK the husband of my child ! " " _UNK _UNK , be tranquil . To fail in _UNK to the authority of the _UNK would be to put yourself out of _UNK . As to what is _UNK to you than life , nothing can be so dear to a good _UNK as the _UNK . " _UNK _UNK hailed this _UNK . The . rang his bell , and with warmth resumed . " If the _UNK should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself , you would have no duty but to sacrifice her . Listen to what is to follow . In the meanwhile , be silent ! " _UNK _UNK were again raised . suspiciously _UNK sat down , with his eyes looking around , and his lips trembling ; his daughter drew closer to him . The _UNK man on a jury rubbed his hands together , and restored the usual hand to his mouth . _UNK was produced , when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard , and rapidly _UNK a story of the imprisonment , and of his having been a mere boy in a Doctor ' s service , and of the release , and of a state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him . This short examination followed , for a court was quick with its work . " You did good service at the taking of the _UNK , _UNK ? " " I believe so . " Here , an excited woman , from the crowd : " You were one of the best _UNK there . Why not say so ? You were the _UNK that day there , and you were among the first to enter a _UNK _UNK when it fell . _UNK , I speak the truth ! " It was The _UNK who , amidst a warm commendations of the audience , thus assisted the proceedings . The . rang his bell ; but , The _UNK , warming with _UNK , shrieked , " I defy that bell ! " Nearer she was likewise much _UNK . " _UNK the _UNK of what you did that day within the _UNK , _UNK . " " I knew , " said _UNK , looking down at his wife , who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised , looking steadily up at him ; " I knew that this prisoner , of whom I speak , had been confined in the cell known as One _UNK and _UNK , North _UNK . I knew it from himself . He knew himself by no other name than One _UNK and _UNK , North _UNK , when he made shoes under my care . As I serve my _UNK that day , I resolve , when the place shall fall , to examine that cell . It . . I _UNK to the cell , with the _UNK who is one of the _UNK , directed by the _UNK . I examine it , very closely . In a hole in the dish , where a stone has been worked out and replaced , I find a written paper . This is that written paper . I have made it my business to examine some _UNK of the writing of Doctor _UNK . This is the writing of Doctor _UNK . I _UNK this paper , in the writing of Doctor _UNK , to the hands of the contrairy . " " Let it be read . " In the dead silence and _UNK prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife , his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father , ' _UNK keeping his eyes fixed on the reader , _UNK _UNK never taking hers from the prisoner , _UNK never taking his from his _UNK wife , and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor , who saw none of _UNK paper was read , as follows . _UNK . The _UNK of the _UNK " I , _UNK _UNK , unfortunate _UNK , native of _UNK , and afterwards _UNK in , , write this melancholy paper in my _UNK cell in the _UNK , during the last month of the year , _UNK . I write it at stolen intervals , under every difficulty . I _UNK to _UNK it in the wall of a dish , where I have slowly and _UNK made a place of concealment for it . Some _UNK hand may find it there , when I and my sorrows are dust . " These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with difficulty in _UNK of soot and _UNK from the , , mixed with blood , in the last month of the _UNK year of my _UNK . _UNK has quite departed from my breast . I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired , but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right _UNK my memory is exact and _UNK that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words , whether they be ever read by men or not , at the _UNK _UNK . " One cloudy _UNK night , in a third week of _UNK ( I think the _UNK of a month ) in the year _UNK , I was walking on the retired part of the _UNK by the _UNK for the refreshment of the _UNK air , at an hour ' s distance from my place of residence in the Street of the _UNK of _UNK , when the carriage came along behind me , driven very fast . As I stood aside to let that carriage pass , _UNK that it might otherwise run me down , the head was put out at the window , and a voice called to the driver to stop . " The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could _UNK in his horses , and the same voice called to me by my name . I answered . The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open a door and _UNK before I came up with it . " I observed that they were both wrapped in _UNK , and appeared to conceal themselves . As they stood side by side near the carriage door , I also observed that they both looked of about my own age , or rather younger , and that they were greatly alike , in stature , manner , voice , and ( as far as I could see ) face too . " ' You are Doctor _UNK ? ' said one . " I am . " " ' Doctor _UNK , formerly of _UNK , ' said the other ; ' the young _UNK , originally an expert surgeon , who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in the ? ' " ' Officer , ' I returned , ' I am that Doctor _UNK of whom you speak so graciously . ' " ' We have been to your residence , ' said the first , ' and not being so fortunate as to find you there , and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction , we followed , in the hope of _UNK you . Will you please to enter the carriage ? ' " The manner of both was _UNK , and they both moved , as these words were spoken , so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door . They were _UNK . I was not . " ' Officer , ' said I , ' pardon me ; but I usually inquire who does me a honour to seek my assistance , and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned . ' " The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second . ' ' , your _UNK are people of condition . As to the nature of the case , our confidence in your skill , us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it . _UNK . Will you please to enter the carriage ? ' " I could do nothing but comply , and I entered it in silence . They both entered after _UNK last springing in , after putting up the steps . The carriage turned about , and drove on at its former speed . " I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred . I have no doubt that it is , word for word , the same . I describe everything exactly as it took place , _UNK my mind not to wander from the task . Where I make a broken marks that follow here , I leave off for the time , and put my paper in its . . _UNK " The carriage left the streets behind , passed the North _UNK , and emerged upon the country road . At _UNK of the _UNK from a _UNK did not estimate the distance at that time , but afterwards when I traversed _UNK struck out of the main _UNK , and presently stopped at a solitary house , We all three alighted , and walked , by a damp soft footpath in the garden where the neglected _UNK had _UNK , to the door of the house . It was not opened immediately , in answer to the ringing of a bell , and one of my two conductors struck the man who opened it , with his heavy _UNK _UNK , across the face . " There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention , for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs . But , the other of the two , being angry likewise , struck a man in like manner with his arm ; a look and bearing of a _UNK were then so exactly alike , that I then first perceived them to be _UNK _UNK . " From the time of our _UNK at the outer gate ( which we found locked , and which one of the _UNK had opened to admit us , and had _UNK ) , I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber . I was conducted to this chamber straight , the cries growing louder as we ascended the stairs , and I found the patient in the high fever of the brain , lying on the bed . " The patient was a woman of great beauty , and young ; assuredly not much past twenty . Her hair was torn and ragged , and her arms were bound to her sides with ' and handkerchiefs . I noticed that these _UNK were all _UNK of a gentleman ' s dress . On one of them , which was the _UNK _UNK for the dress of ceremony , I saw the _UNK _UNK of the _UNK , and the letter _UNK . " I saw this , within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient ; for , in her restless _UNK she had turned over on her face on the edge of the bed , had drawn the end of the _UNK into her mouth , and was in danger of suffocation . My first act was to put out my hand to relieve her courts ; and in moving a _UNK aside , the _UNK in the corner caught my sight . " I turned her gently over , placed my hands upon her breast to calm her and keep her down , and looked into her face . Her eyes were dilated and wild , and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks , and repeated the words , ' My husband , my father , and my brother ! ' and then counted up to twelve , and said , ' Hush ! ' For an instant , and no more , she would pause to listen , and then the piercing shrieks would begin again , and she would repeat the cry , ' My husband , my father , and my brother ! ' and would count up to twelve , and say , ' Hush ! ' There was no _UNK in the order , or the manner . There was no cessation , but a regular moment ' s pause , in the utterance of these sounds . " ' How long , ' I asked , ' has this lasted ? ' " To traversed the _UNK , I will call them a elder and the younger ; by the elder , I mean him who _UNK the most authority . It was the elder who replied , ' _UNK about this hour last night . ' " ' She has the husband , the father , and the brother ? ' " ' The brother . ' " ' I do not address her brother ? ' " He answered with great contempt , ' No . ' " ' She has some recent _UNK with a number twelve ? ' " The younger brother impatiently rejoined , ' With twelve o ' clock ? ' " ' See , gentlemen , ' said I , still keeping my hands upon her breast , ' how useless I am , as you have brought me ! If I had known what I was coming to see , I could have come provided . As it is , time must be lost . There are no _UNK to be obtained in this lonely place . ' " The elder brother looked to the younger , who said _UNK , ' There is the case of _UNK here ; ' and brought it from the closet , and put it on the table . _UNK " I opened some of the bottles , the them , and put a _UNK to my lips . If I had wanted to use anything save _UNK _UNK that were _UNK in themselves , I would not have administered any of those . " ' Do you doubt them ? ' asked the younger brother . " ' You see , _UNK , I am going to use them , ' I replied , and said no more . " I made the patient swallow , with great difficulty , and after many efforts , the dose that I desired to give . As I intended to repeat it after the while , and as it was necessary to watch its influence , I then sat down by the side of the bed . There was the timid and smoothed woman in attendance ( wife of the man _UNK ) , who had ' into the corner . A house was damp and besought , _UNK _UNK , recently occupied and _UNK used . Some thick old _UNK had been nailed up before the windows , to _UNK the sound of the shrieks . They continued to be uttered in their regular courts , with the cry , ' My husband , my father , and my brother ! ' the counting up to twelve , and ' Hush ! ' A _UNK was so violent , that I had not unfastened the _UNK _UNK the arms ; but , I had looked to them , to see that they were not painful . The only spark of _UNK in the case , was , that my hand upon the _UNK ' s breast had this much soothing influence , that for minutes at the time it _UNK a figure . It had no effect upon the cries ; no _UNK could be more regular . " For a reason that my hand had this effect ( I assume ) , I had sat by the side of the bed for half an hour , with the two _UNK looking on , before the elder said : " ' There is another patient . ' " I was startled , and asked , ' Is it a pressing case ? ' " ' You had better see , ' he carelessly answered ; and took up the light . _UNK " The other patient lay in the back room across the second staircase , which was a species of _UNK over the _UNK . There was a low _UNK ceiling to the part of it ; the rest was open , to the _UNK of the _UNK roof , and there were beams across . _UNK and straw were _UNK in that portion of the place , _UNK for _UNK , and a heap of apples in _UNK . I had to pass through that part , to get at the other . My memory is circumstantial and _UNK . I try it with these details , and I see them all , in this my cell in a _UNK , near a close of the _UNK year of my _UNK , as I saw them all that night . " On some _UNK on the ground , with the _UNK thrown under his head , lay a handsome _UNK boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most . He lay on his back , with his teeth set , his right hand clenched on his breast , and his glaring eyes looking straight upward . I could not see where his wound was , as I _UNK on one knee over him ; but , I could see that he was dying of a wound from the sharp point . " ' I am the doctor , my poor fellow , ' said I . ' Let me examine it . ' " ' I do not want it examined , ' he answered ; ' let it be . ' " It was under his hand , and I soothed him to let me move his hand away . The wound was the _UNK , received from twenty to _UNK hours before , but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay . He was then dying fast . As I turned my eyes to the elder brother , I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was _UNK out , as if he were a wounded bird , or _UNK , or scraped ; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature . " ' How has this been done , _UNK ? ' said I . " ' The _UNK young common dog ! A _UNK ! _UNK my brother to draw upon him , and has fallen by my brother ' s _UNK the gentleman . ' " There was no touch of pity , sorrow , or kindred humanity , in this answer . The speaker seemed to _UNK that it was _UNK to have that different order of creature dying there , and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure _UNK of his _UNK kind . He was quite incapable of any long-forgotten feeling about the boy , or about his fate . " The boy ' s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken , and they now slowly moved to me . " ' Doctor , they are very proud , these _UNK ; but we common dogs are proud too , sometimes . They plunder us , _UNK us , beat us , kill us ; but we have a little pride left , sometimes . _UNK you seen her , Doctor ? ' " A shrieks and the cries were audible there , though subdued by the distance . He referred to them , as if she were lying in our presence . " I said , ' I have seen her . ' " ' She is my sister , Doctor . They have had their _UNK rights , these _UNK , in a _UNK and virtue of our , , many years , but we have had good girls among us . I know it , and have heard my father say so . She was the good girl . She was _UNK to a good young man , too : the _UNK of his . We were all _UNK of _UNK man ' s who stands there . The other is his brother , the worst of a bad race . ' " It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered the force to speak ; but , his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis . " ' We were so robbed by that man who stands there , as all we common dogs are by those superior _UNK by him without mercy , obliged to work for him without pay , obliged to grind our corn at his mill , obliged to feed scores of his _UNK birds on our wretched _UNK , and _UNK for our lives to keep a single _UNK bird of our own , _UNK and _UNK to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat , we ate it in fear , with the door barred and the shutters closed , that his people should not see it and take it from _UNK say , we were so robbed , and _UNK , and were made so poor , that our father told us it was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world , and that what we should most pray for , was , that our women might be _UNK and our miserable race die out ! ' " I had never before seen a sense of being a , bursting forth like the fire . I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere ; but , I had never seen it break out , until I saw it in the dying boy . " ' _UNK , ' , my sister married . He was _UNK at that time , poor fellow , and she married her courts , that she might tend and comfort him in our _UNK _UNK , as that man would call it . She had not been married many weeks , when that man ' s brother saw her and _UNK her , and asked that man to lend her to _UNK what are ' among us ! He was willing enough , but my sister was good and virtuous , and shielding his brother with the hatred as strong as mine . What did the two then , to _UNK her husband to use his influence with her , to make her willing ? ' " The boy ' s eyes , which had been fixed on mine , slowly turned to a looker-on , and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true . A two opposing kinds of pride , one another , I can see , even in this _UNK ; the gentleman ' s , all _UNK indifference ; the _UNK ' s , all _UNK sentiment , and passionate revenge . " ' You know , ' , that it is among the _UNK of these _UNK to _UNK us common dogs to carts , and drive us . They so harnessed him and drove him . You know that it is among their _UNK to keep us in their grounds all night , _UNK a _UNK , in order that their noble sleep may not be disturbed . They kept him out in a unwholesome _UNK at night , and ordered him back into his _UNK in the day . But he was not persuaded . No ! _UNK out of _UNK one day at noon , to _UNK he could find _UNK sobbed twelve times , once for every stroke of the bell , and died on her bosom . ' " Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong . He forced back a gathering shadows of death , as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched , and to cover his wound . " ' Then , with that man ' s permission and even with his aid , his brother took her away ; in spite of what I know she must have told his _UNK what that is , will not be long unknown to you , ' , if it is _UNK brother took her _UNK his pleasure and _UNK , for a little while . I saw her pass me on the road . When I took a _UNK home , our father ' s heart burst ; he never spoke one of the words that filled it . I took my young sister ( for I have another ) to the place beyond the reach of this man , and where , at least , she will never be ' _UNK . Then , I tracked the brother here , and last night climbed _UNK common dog , but _UNK in hand . _UNK is the _UNK window ? It was somewhere here ? ' " The room was _UNK to his sight ; the world was _UNK around him . I glanced about me , and saw that a _UNK and straw were recruiting over the floor , as if there had been the struggle . " ' She heard me , and ran in . I told her not to come near us till he was dead . He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money ; then struck at me with a quill . But I , though a common dog , so struck at him as to make him draw . Let him break into as many pieces as he will , the _UNK that he Appears with my common blood ; he drew to defend _UNK at me with all his skill for his life . ' " My glance had fallen , but a few moments before , on the fragments of the broken _UNK , lying among the _UNK . That diff was a gentleman ' s . In another place , lay an old _UNK that seemed to have been the _UNK ' s . " ' Now , lift me up , Doctor ; lift me up . Where is he ? ' " ' He is not here , ' I said , supporting the boy , and thinking that he referred to the brother . " ' He ! grade as these _UNK are , he is afraid to see me . Where is the man who was here ? cheerless my face to him . ' " I did so , raising the boy ' s head against my knee . But , _UNK for a moment with extraordinary power , he raised himself completely : obliging me to rise too , or I could not have still supported him . " ' _UNK , ' said the boy , turned to him with his eyes opened wide , and his right hand raised , ' in the days when all these things are to be answered for , I summon you and yours , to the last of your bad race , to answer for them . I mark this cross of blood upon you , as a sign that I do it . In the days when all these things are to be answered for , I summon your brother , the worst of a bad race , to answer for them _UNK . I mark this cross of blood upon him , as a sign that I do it . ' " _UNK , he put his hand to the wound in his breast , and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air . He stood for an instant with the finger yet raised , and as it dropped , he dropped with it , and I laid him down dead . _UNK " When I returned to the bedside of the young woman , I found her raving in precisely the same order of _UNK . I knew that this might last for many hours , and that it would probably end in the silence of a grave . " I repeated the _UNK I had given her , and I sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced . She never abated the piercing precursor of her shrieks , never stumbled in a allowance or the order of her words . They were always ' My husband , my father , and my brother ! One , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten , eleven , twelve . Hush ! ' " This lasted _UNK hours from the time when I first saw her . I had come and gone twice , and was again sitting by her , when she began to _UNK . I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity , and _UNK she sank into the _UNK , and lay like the dead . " It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last , after a long and fearful _UNK . I released her arms , and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn . It was then that I knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen ; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had had of her . " ' Is she dead ? ' asked the _UNK , whom I will still describe as the elder brother , coming _UNK into the room from his horse . " ' Not dead , ' said I ; ' but like to die . ' " ' What strength there is in these common bodies ! ' he said , looking down at her with some curiosity . " ' There is _UNK strength , ' I answered him , ' in sorrow and despair . ' " He first laughed at my words , and then reposing at them . He moved a chair with his foot near to mine , ordered a woman away , and said in a subdued voice , " ' Doctor , finding my brother in this difficulty with these _UNK , I recommended that your aid should be invited . Your reputation is high , and , as a young man with your fortune to make , you are probably mindful of your interest . The things that you see here , are things to be seen , and not spoken of . ' " I listened to the patient ' s , , and avoided answering . " ' Do you honour me with your attention , Doctor ? ' " ' _UNK , ' said I , ' in my profession , the communications of _UNK are always received in confidence . ' I was ' in my answer , for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen . " Her , was so difficult to trace , that I carefully tried the pulse and the heart . There was life , and no more . Looking round as I resumed my seat , I found both the _UNK intent upon me . _UNK " I write with so much difficulty , a cold is so severe , I am so fearful of being _UNK and consigned to an _UNK cell and total darkness , that I must _UNK this narrative . There is no confusion or failure in my memory ; it can recall , and could reticule , every word that was ever spoken between me and those _UNK . " She lingered for a week . Towards the last , I could understand some few _UNK that she said to me , by placing my ear close to her lips . She asked me where she was , and I told her ; who I was , and I told her . It was in vain that I asked her for her family name . She faintly shook her head upon the pillow , and kept her secret , as the boy had done . " I had no opportunity of asking her any question , until I had told a _UNK she was sinking fast , and could not live another day . _UNK then , though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save a woman and myself , one or other of them had always _UNK sat behind the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there . But when it came to that , they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her ; as _UNK thought passed through my _UNK were dying too . " I always observed that their pride bitterly _UNK the younger brother ' s ( as I call him ) having crossed _UNK with the _UNK , and that _UNK the boy . The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind of either of them was the consideration that this was highly _UNK to the family , and was ridiculous . As often as I caught the younger brother ' s eyes , their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply , for knowing what I knew from the boy . He was _UNK and more polite to me than the elder ; but I saw this . I also saw that I was an _UNK in the mind of the elder , too . " My patient died , two hours before _UNK the time , by my watch , answering almost to a minute when I had first seen her . I was alone with her , when her _UNK young head drooped gently on one side , and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows _UNK . " A _UNK were waiting in the room _UNK , impatient to ride away . I had heard them , alone at the bedside , striking their boots with their _UNK , and loitering up and down . " ' At last she is dead ? ' said the elder , when I went in . " ' She is dead , ' said I . " ' I _UNK you , my brother , ' were his words as he turned round . " He had before offered me money , which I had postponed taking . He now gave me the _UNK of gold . I took it from his hand , but laid it on the table . I had considered the question , and had resolved to accept nothing . " ' Pray excuse me , ' said I . ' Under the circumstances , no . ' " They exchanged looks , but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to them , and we parted without another word on either side . _UNK " I am weary , weary , _UNK down by misery . I cannot read what I have written with this gaunt hand . " Early in the morning , the _UNK of gold was left at my door in a little box , with my name on the outside . From the first , I had anxiously considered what I ought to do . I decided , that day , to write _UNK to the _UNK , stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned , and the place to which I had gone : in effect , stating all the circumstances . I knew what _UNK influence was , and what the _UNK of the _UNK were , and I expected that the matter would never be heard of ; but , I wished to relieve my own mind . I had kept the matter a profound secret , even from my wife ; and this , too , I resolved to state in my letter . I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger ; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others , if others were _UNK by possessing the knowledge that I possessed . " I was much engaged that day , and could not complete my letter that night . I rose long before my usual time next morning to _UNK it . It was the last day of the year . A letter was lying before me just completed , when I was told that a lady waited , who wished to see me . _UNK " I am growing more and more monstrous to the task I have set myself . It is so cold , so dark , my senses are so _UNK , and the gloom upon me is so dreadful . " The lady was young , engaging , and handsome , but not thieved for long life . She was in great agitation . She presented herself to me as the wife of the _UNK St . _UNK . I connected the _UNK by which the boy had addressed the elder brother , with the _UNK letter _UNK on the _UNK , and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately . " My memory is still ' , but I cannot write the words of our conversation . I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was , and I know not at what times I may be watched . She had in part suspected , and in part discovered , the main facts of the cruel story , of her husband ' s share in it , and my being resorted to . She did not know that the girl was dead . Her hope had been , she said in great distress , to show her , in secret , the woman ' s sympathy . Her hope had been to _UNK the wrath of Heaven from the House that had long been _UNK to the suffering many . " She had reasons for _UNK that there was a young sister living , and her greatest desire was , to help that sister . I could tell her nothing but that there was such a sister ; beyond that , I knew nothing . Her menial to come to me , _UNK on my confidence , had been the hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode . resided , to this wretched hour I am ignorant of both . _UNK " These _UNK of paper fail me . One was taken from me , with a warning , yesterday . I must _UNK my record to-day . " She was the good , collaring lady , and not happy in her George . How could she be ! The brother a and disliked her , and his influence was all _UNK to her ; she stood in dread of him , and in dread of her husband too . When I handed her down to the door , there was a child , the pretty boy from two to three years old , in her carriage . " ' For his sake , ' , ' she said , pointing to him in tears , ' I would do all I can to make what poor _UNK I can . He will never prosper in his inheritance otherwise . I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this , it will one day be required of him . What I have left to call my _UNK is little beyond the worth of a few _UNK will make it the first charge of his life to bestow , with the compassion and _UNK of his dead mother , on this injured family , if a sister can be discovered . ' " She kissed the boy , and said , _UNK him , ' It is for _UNK own dear sake . _UNK _UNK be faithful , little Charles ? ' The child answered her courts , ' Yes ! ' I kissed her hand , and she took him in her arms , and went away _UNK him . I never saw her more . " As she had mentioned her husband ' s name in the _UNK that I knew it , I added no mention of it to my letter . I sealed my letter , and , not , it out of my own hands , delivered it myself that day . " That night , the last night of the year , towards nine o ' clock , a man in the black dress rang at my gate , demanded to see me , and softly followed my servant , _UNK _UNK , the youth , _UNK . When my servant came into a room where I sat with my _UNK my wife , beloved of my heart ! My fair young English wife ! _UNK saw the man , who was supposed to be at the gate , standing silent behind him . " An _UNK case in the _UNK St . _UNK , he said . It would not _UNK me , he had the coach in waiting . " It brought me here , it brought me to my grave . When I was clear of the house , a black _UNK was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind , and my arms were refreshed . The two _UNK crossed the road from a dark corner , and ' me with a single gesture . The _UNK took from his pocket the letter I had written , showed it me , burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held , and extinguished the ashes with his foot . Not a word was spoken . I was brought here , I was brought to my living grave . " If it had pleased _UNK to put it in a hard heart of either of the _UNK , in all these frightful years , to _UNK me any _UNK of my dearest _UNK much as to let me know by a word whether alive or _UNK might have thought that He had not quite waxwork them . But , now I believe that a mark of a red cross is fatal to them , and that they have no part in His . . And them and their _UNK , to the last of their race , I , _UNK _UNK , unhappy prisoner , do this last night of the year _UNK , in my _UNK agony , _UNK to the times when all these things shall be answered for . I _UNK them to Heaven and to earth . " The terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done . The sound of _UNK and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood . The narrative called up the most _UNK passions of the time , and there was not the head in the _UNK but must have dropped before it . Little need , in presence of that _UNK and that _UNK , to show how the _UNK had not made the paper public , with the other captured _UNK _UNK borne in _UNK , and had kept it , _UNK their time . Little need to show that this the family name had long been _UNK by Saint _UNK , and was wrought into the tones register . The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day , against such _UNK . And all the worse for the _UNK man , that the _UNK was the well-known _UNK , his own attached friend , the father of his wife . One of the _UNK _UNK of the ' was , for _UNK of the _UNK public virtues of _UNK , and for _UNK and _UNK on the people ' s . . _UNK when the the said ( else had his own head quivered on his shoulders ) , that a good _UNK of the _UNK would deserve better still of the _UNK by _UNK out an _UNK family of _UNK , and would doubtless feel a calves glow and joy in making his daughter a flutter and her child an orphan , there was wild excitement , patriotic fervour , not a touch of human sympathy . " Much influence around him , has that Doctor ? " murmured _UNK _UNK , smiling to The _UNK . " Save him now , my Doctor , save him ! " At every juryman ' s vote , there was a roar . Another and another . _UNK and roar . _UNK _UNK . At heart and by _UNK an _UNK , an enemy of the _UNK , a notorious _UNK of the People . inability to the _UNK , and Death within four-and-twenty hours ! _UNK . _UNK The wretched wife of the innocent man thus _UNK to die , fell under the sentence , as if she had been mortally stricken . But , she uttered no sound ; and so strong was a voice within her , _UNK that it was she of all the world who must _UNK him in his misery and not _UNK it , that it quickly raised her , even from that ' . A the having to take part in the public demonstration out of doors , the _UNK _UNK . The quick noise and hundreds of a court ' s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased , when _UNK stood stretching out her arms towards her husband , with nothing in her face but love and consolation . " If I might touch him ! If I might embrace him once ! _UNK , good citizens , if you would have so much compassion for us ! " There was but the _UNK left , along with two of the four men who had taken him last night , and _UNK . The people had all poured out to a show in the streets . _UNK a to the rest , " Let her embrace him then ; it is but the moment . " It was _UNK acquiesced in , and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place , where he , by leaning over a waggons , could fold her in his arms . " Farewell , dear darling of my soul . My parting blessing on my love . We shall meet again , where a weary are at rest ! " They were her husband ' s words , as he held her to his bosom . " I can bear it , dear Charles . I am supported from above : don ' t suffer for me . A parting blessing for our child . " " I send it to her by you . I kiss her by you . I say farewell to her by you . " " My husband . No ! A moment ! " He was tearing himself apart from her . " We shall not be a long . I feel that this will break my heart _UNK ; but I will do my duty while I can , and when I leave her , God will raise up friends for her , as He did for me . " Her father had followed her , and would have fallen on his knees to both of them , but that _UNK put out the hand and seized him , crying : " No , no ! What have you done , what have you done , that you should kneel to us ! We know now , what a struggle you made of old . We know , now what you underwent when you suspected my _UNK , and when you knew it . We know now , the natural antipathy you strove against , and _UNK , for her dear sake . We thank you with all our hearts , and all our love and duty . Heaven be with you ! " Her father ' s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair , and _UNK them with a shriek of anguish . " It could not be otherwise , " said the prisoner . " All things have worked together as they have fallen out . It was the _UNK endeavour to discharge my poor mother ' s trust that first brought my fatal presence near you . Good could never come of such evil , the happier end was not in nature to so unhappy the beginning . Be _UNK , and forgive me . Heaven bless you ! " As he was drawn away , his wife released him , and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer , and with a a look upon her face , in which there was even a comforting smile . As he went out at a bird ' door , she turned , laid her head lovingly on her father ' s breast , tried to speak to him , and fell at his feet . Then , _UNK from the obscure corner from which he had never moved , _UNK _UNK came and took her up . Only her father and Mr . _UNK were with her . His arm trembled as it raised her , and supported her head . _UNK , there was an air about him that was not all of _UNK had a flush of pride in it . " Shall I take her to the coach ? I shall never feel her weight . " He carried her lightly to the door , and laid her tenderly down in the coach . Her father and their old friend got into it , and he took his seat beside the driver . When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in a dark not many hours before , to picture to himself on which of the rough ' of the street her feet had trodden , he lifted her again , and carried her up the staircase to their rooms . There , he laid her down on a couch , where her child and Miss _UNK wept over her . " Don ' t recall her to herself , " he said , softly , to the latter , " she is better so . Don ' t revive her to consciousness , while she only Mr . " " Oh , _UNK , _UNK , dear _UNK ! " cried little _UNK , springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him , in a burst of grief . " Now that you have come , I think you will do something to help _UNK , something to save _UNK ! _UNK , look at her , dear _UNK ! teaspoon you , of all the people who love her , bear to see her so ? " He bent over the child , and laid her blooming cheek against his face . He put her gently from him , and looked at her unconscious mother . " Before I go , " he said , and _UNK " I may kiss her ? " It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips , he murmured some words . The child , who was nearest to him , told them afterwards , and told her _UNK when she was a handsome old lady , that she heard him say , " The life you love . " When he had gone out into the next room , he turned suddenly on Mr . _UNK and her father , who were following , and said to the latter : " You had great influence but yesterday , ' _UNK ; let it at least be tried . These triumphantly , and all the men in power , are very friendly to you , and very _UNK of your services ; are they not ? " " Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me . I had the strongest assurances that I should save him ; and I did . " He returned the answer in great trouble , and very slowly . " Try them again . A hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short , but try . " " I intend to try . I will not rest the moment . " " That ' s well . I have known such energy as yours do great things before _UNK never , " he added , with a smile and a sigh together , " such great things as this . But try ! Of little worth as life is when we _UNK it , it is worth that effort . It would cost nothing to lay down if it were not . " " I will go , " said Doctor _UNK , " to the _UNK and a weakest straight , and I will go to others whom it is better not to name . I will write too , _UNK stay ! There is the _UNK in the streets , and no one will be _UNK until dark . " " That ' s true . Well ! It is the _UNK hope at the best , and not much the _UNK for being _UNK till dark . I should like to know how you speed ; though , mind ! I expect nothing ! When are you likely to have seen these dread powers , ' _UNK ? " " Immediately after dark , I should hope . assuming an hour or two from this . " " It will be dark soon after four . Let us _UNK a hour or two . If I go to Mr . _UNK ' s at nine , shall I hear what you have done , either from our friend or from yourself ? " " Yes . " " May you prosper ! " Mr . _UNK followed _UNK to the outer door , and , touching him on the shoulder as he was going away , caused him to turn . " I have no hope , " said Mr . _UNK , in a low and sorrowful whisper . " Nor have I . " " If any one of these men , or all of these men , were disposed to spare _UNK is a large supposition ; for what is his life , or any man ' s to them ! --I doubt if they , spare him after the demonstration in the court . " " And so do I . I heard a fall of the _UNK in that sound . " Mr . _UNK leaned his arm upon the _UNK , and bowed his face upon it . " Don ' t _UNK , " said _UNK , very gently ; " don ' t _UNK . I encouraged ' _UNK in this idea , because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her . _UNK , she might think ' his life was _UNK thrown away or wasted , ' and that might trouble her . " " Yes , yes , yes , " returned Mr . _UNK , _UNK his eyes , " you are right . But he will _UNK ; there is no real hope . " " Yes . He will _UNK : there is no real hope , " echoed _UNK . And walked with a settled step , _UNK . _UNK . magnificent _UNK _UNK paused in the street , not quite decided where to go . " At _UNK ' s _UNK at nine , " he said , with a musing face . " Shall I do well , in the mean time , to show myself ? I think so . It is best that these people should know there is such a man as I here ; it is a sound precaution , and may be the necessary preparation . But care , care , care ! Let me think it out ! " _UNK his steps which had begun to tend towards an object , he took a turn or two in a already _UNK street , and aimed the thought in his mind to its possible consequences . His first impression was confirmed . " It is best , " he said , finally resolved , " that these people should know there is such a man as I here . " And he turned his face towards Saint _UNK . _UNK had described himself , that day , as a keeper of the _UNK in the Saint _UNK suburb . It was not difficult for one who knew the city well , to find his house without asking any question . Having WHAT its situation , _UNK came out of those closer streets again , and happen at the place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner . For the first time in many years , he had no strong drink . _UNK last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine , and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr . _UNK ' s hearth like the man who had done with it . It was as late as seven o ' clock when he awoke refreshed , and went out into the streets again . As he passed along towards Saint _UNK , he stopped at the _UNK where there was a _UNK , and slightly altered a disordered arrangement of his loose cravat , and his coat-collar , and his wild hair . This done , he went on direct to _UNK ' s , and went in . There happened to be no customer in the shop but _UNK Three , of a restless fingers and the _UNK voice . This man , whom he had seen upon the _UNK , stood drinking at the little counter , in conversation with a _UNK , man and wife . The _UNK assisted in the conversation , like the regular member of the establishment . As _UNK walked in , took his seat and asked ( in very _UNK French ) for the small measure of wine , _UNK _UNK cast a careless glance at him , and then the _UNK , and then the _UNK , and then advanced to him herself , and asked him what it was he had ordered . He repeated what he had already said . " English ? " asked _UNK _UNK , _UNK raising her dark eyebrows . After looking at her , as if the sound of even a single French word were slow to express itself to him , he answered , in his former strong inhabited accent . " Yes , _UNK , yes . I am English ! " _UNK _UNK returned to her counter to get the wine , and , as he took up the _UNK _UNK and _UNK to ' over it _UNK out its meaning , he heard her say , " I swear to you , like _UNK ! " _UNK brought him the wine , and gave him Good _UNK . " How ? " " Good evening . " " Oh ! Good evening , _UNK , " filling his glass . " Ah ! and good wine . I drink to the _UNK . " _UNK went back to the counter , and said , " Certainly , a little like . " _UNK sternly retorted , " I tell you a good deal like . " _UNK Three _UNK remarked , " He is so much in your mind , see you , _UNK . " The amiable _UNK added , with a laugh , " Yes , my _UNK ! And you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more to-morrow ! " _UNK followed the , and words of his paper , with a slow forefinger , and with the _UNK and absorbed face . They were all leaning their arms on the counter close together , speaking low . After the silence of a few moments , during which they all looked towards him without _UNK his . attention from the _UNK _UNK , they resumed their conversation . " It is true what _UNK says , " observed _UNK Three . " Why stop ? There is great force in that . Why stop ? " " Well , well , " reasoned _UNK , " but one must stop somewhere . After all , the question is still where ? " " At _UNK , " said _UNK . " _UNK ! " croaked _UNK Three . The _UNK , also , highly approved . " _UNK is good _UNK , my wife , " said _UNK , rather troubled ; " in general , I say nothing against it . But this Doctor has suffered much ; you have seen him to-day ; you have observed his face when the paper was read . " " I have observed his face ! " repeated _UNK , contemptuously and angrily . " Yes . I have observed his face . I have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the _UNK . Let him take care of his face ! " " And you have observed , my wife , " said _UNK , in the _UNK manner , " the anguish of his daughter , which must be the dreadful anguish to him ! " " I have observed his daughter , " repeated _UNK ; " yes , I have observed his daughter , more times than one . I have observed her to-day , and I have observed her other days . I have observed her in a court , and I have observed her in the street by a prison . Let me but lift my _UNK ! " She seemed to raise it ( a listener ' s eyes were always on his paper ) , and to let it fall with a _UNK on the _UNK before her , as if the _UNK had dropped . " The _UNK is always ! " croaked the _UNK . " She is an Angel ! " said The _UNK , and dry her . " As to _UNK , " pursued _UNK , _UNK , addressing her husband , " if it _UNK on _UNK , happily , it does _UNK _UNK rescue this man even now . " " No ! " protested _UNK . " Not if to lift this glass would do it ! But I would leave the matter there . I say , stop there . " " See you then , _UNK , " said _UNK _UNK , _UNK ; " and see you , too , my little _UNK ; see you both ! Listen ! For other crimes as _UNK and _UNK , I have this race a long time on my grade , _UNK to destruction and _UNK . _UNK my husband , is that so . " " It is so , " _UNK _UNK , without being asked . " In the beginning of a great days , when a _UNK ; , he finds this paper of to-day , and he brings it home , and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut , we read it , here on this spot , by the light of this lamp . _UNK him , is that so . " " It is so , " _UNK _UNK . " That night , I tell him , when the paper is read through , and a lamp is burnt out , and a day is rotting in above those shutters and between those iron bars , that I have now a secret to communicate . _UNK him , is that so . " " It is so , " _UNK _UNK again . " I communicate to him that secret . I _UNK this bosom with these two hands as I _UNK it now , and I tell him , ' _UNK , I was brought up among the _UNK of the _UNK , and that _UNK family so injured by the two _UNK _UNK , as that _UNK paper _UNK , is my family . _UNK , that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister , that husband was my sister ' s husband , that _UNK child was their child , that brother was my brother , that father was my father , those dead are my dead , and that summons to answer for those things _UNK to me ! ' _UNK him , is that so . " " It is so , " _UNK _UNK once more . " Then tell _UNK and Fire where to stop , " returned _UNK ; " but don ' t tell me . " sufficient her hearers derived a horrible _UNK from a deadly nature of her _UNK listener could feel how white she was , without seeing the both highly _UNK it . _UNK , a weak minority , interposed a few words for the memory of the wily wife of the _UNK ; but only diverged from his own wife the repetition of her last reply . " Tell the _UNK and the bullet where to stop ; not me ! " _UNK entered , and the group was broken up . The English customer paid for what he had had , _UNK counted his change , and asked , as the stranger , to be directed towards the _UNK _UNK . _UNK _UNK took him to the door , and put her arm on his , in pointing out the road . The English customer was not without his reflections then , that it might be a good deed to _UNK that arm , lift it , and strike under it sharp and deep . But , he went his way , and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of a prison wall . At the appointed hour , he emerged from it to present himself in Mr . _UNK ' s room again , where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety . He said he had been with _UNK until just now , and had only left her for a few minutes , to come and keep his appointment . Her father had not been seen , since he quitted the _UNK towards four o ' clock . She had some faint hopes that his _UNK might save Charles , but they were very slight . He had been more than five hours gone : where could he be ? Mr . _UNK waited until ten ; but , ' _UNK not returning , and he being unwilling to leave _UNK any longer , it was arranged that he should go back to her , and come to the _UNK again at midnight . In the meanwhile , _UNK would wait alone by the fire for a Doctor . He waited and waited , and the clock struck twelve ; but Doctor _UNK did not come back . Mr . _UNK returned , and found no _UNK of him , and brought none . Where could he be ? They were _UNK this question , and were almost building up some weak _UNK of hope on his prolonged absence , when they heard him on the stairs . A instant he entered the room , it was plain that all was lost . Whether he had really been to any one , or whether he had been all that time _UNK the streets , was never known . As he stood staring at them , they asked him no question , for his face told them everything . " I cannot find it , " said he , " and I must have it . Where is it ? " His head and throat were bare , and , as he spoke with a helpless look often all around , he took his coat off , and let it drop on the floor . " Where is my bench ? I have been looking the for my bench , and I can ' t find it . What have they done with my work ? _UNK _UNK : I must _UNK those shoes . " They looked at one another , and their hearts died within them . " Come , come ! " said he , in a whimpering miserable way ; " let me get to work . Give me my work . " _UNK no answer , he tore his hair , and beat his feet upon the ground , like a distracted child . " Don ' t torture the poor _UNK wretch , " he ' them , with a dreadful cry ; " but give me my work ! What is to become of us , if those shoes are not done to-night ? " leader , utterly lost ! It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him , or try to restore him , _UNK if by _UNK each put a hand upon his shoulder , and soothed him to sit down before the fire , with a promise that he should have his work presently . He sank into a chair , and _UNK over the _UNK , and shed tears . As if all that had happened since the _UNK time were a momentary fancy , or a dream , Mr . _UNK saw him shrink into the exact figure that _UNK had had in keeping . _UNK , and impressed with terror as they both were , by this spectacle of , , it was not a time to yield to such emotions . His lonely daughter , bereft of her final hope and _UNK , appealed to them both too strongly . Again , as if by agreement , they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces . _UNK was the first to speak : " The last chance is gone : it was not much . Yes ; he had better be taken to her . But , before you go , will you , for a moment , steadily attend to me ? Don ' t ask me why I make the _UNK I am going to make , and exact a promise I am going to exact ; I have a _UNK good one . " " I do not doubt it , " answered Mr . _UNK . " Say on . " A figure in a chair between them , was all the time _UNK ' itself to and fro , and moaning . They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by the _UNK in the night . _UNK stooped to pick up the coat , which lay almost _UNK his feet . As he did so , a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the _UNK of his day ' s duties , fell lightly on the floor . _UNK took it up , and there was the folded paper in it . " We should look at this ! " he said . Mr . _UNK nodded his consent . He opened it , and exclaimed , " Thank _UNK ! _UNK " " What is it ? " asked Mr . _UNK , eagerly . " The moment ! Let me speak of it in its place . leader , " he put his hand in his coat , and took another paper from it , " that is a _UNK which _UNK me to pass out of this city . Look at it . You _UNK _UNK , an Englishman ? " Mr . _UNK held it open in his hand , gazing in his earnest face . " Keep it for me until to-morrow . I shall see him to-morrow , you remember , and I had better not take it into a prison . " " Why not ? " " I don ' t know ; I prefer not to do so . Now , take this paper that Doctor _UNK has carried about him . It is a similar _UNK , _UNK him and his daughter and her child , at any time , to pass a _UNK and the _UNK ! You see ? " " Yes ! " " Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil , yesterday . When is it , ? But no matter ; don ' t stay to look ; put it up carefully with mine and your own . Now , observe ! I never _UNK until within this hour or two , that he had , or could have such the paper . It is good , until recalled . But it may be soon recalled , and , I have reason to think , will be . " " They are not in danger ? " " They are in great danger . They are in danger of _UNK by _UNK _UNK . I know it from her own lips . I have overheard words of that woman ' s , to-night , which have presented their danger to me in strong colours . I have lost no time , and since then , I have seen the spy . He _UNK me . He knows that the _UNK , living by a prison wall , is under the scourings of the _UNK , and has been _UNK by _UNK _UNK as to his having seen Her " , never mentioned _UNK ' s _UNK " making signs and signals to it . It is easy to the that a pretence will be a common one , the prison plot , and that it will involve her _UNK perhaps her child ' _UNK perhaps her father ' _UNK both have been seen with her at that place . Don ' t look so _UNK . You will save them all . " " Heaven _UNK I may , _UNK ! But how ? " " I am going to tell you how . It will depend on you , and it could depend on no better man . This new _UNK will certainly not take place until after to-morrow ; probably not until two or three days afterwards ; more probably a week afterwards . You know it is a capital crime , to _UNK for , or _UNK with , the victim of the _UNK . She and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime , and this woman ( the _UNK of whose pursuit cannot be described ) would wait to add that strength to her case , and make herself doubly sure . You follow me ? " " So attentively , and with so much confidence in what you say , that for the moment I lose sight , " touching the back of a Doctor ' s chair , " even of this distress . " " You have money , and can buy the means of travelling to the _UNK as quickly as the journey can be made . Your preparations have been completed for some days , to return to goblin . magnificent to-morrow have your horses ready , so that they may be in starting _UNK at two o ' clock in the afternoon . " " It shall be done ! " His manner was so fervent and _UNK , that Mr . _UNK caught the flame , and was as quick as youth . " You are a noble heart . Did I say we could depend upon no better man ? Tell her , to-night , what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father . _UNK upon that , for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband ' s cheerfully . " He faltered for an instant ; then went on as before . " For the sake of her child and her father , press upon her the necessity of leaving , , with them and you , at that hour . Tell her that it was her husband ' s last arrangement . Tell her that more _UNK upon it than she dare believe , or hope . You think that her father , even in this sad state , will submit himself to her ; do you not ? " " I am sure of it . " " I thought so . _UNK and steadily have all these identify made in the _UNK here , even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage . The moment I come to you , take me in , and drive away . " " I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances ? " " You have my _UNK in your hand with the rest , you know , and will reserve my place . Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied , and then for England ! " " Why , then , " said Mr . _UNK , grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand , " it does not all depend on one old man , but I shall have a young and ardent man at my side . " " By a help of Heaven you shall ! _UNK me solemnly that nothing will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand house-lad to one another . " " Nothing , _UNK . " " Remember these words to-morrow : change the course , or delay in _UNK any _UNK no life can possibly be saved , and many lives must inevitably be the . " " I will remember them . I hope to do my part faithfully . " " And I hope to do mine . Now , good bye ! " Though he said it with the grave smile of earnestness , and though he even put the old man ' s hand to his lips , he did not part from him then . He helped him so far to _UNK a . figure before the dying _UNK , as to get a cloak and hat put upon it , and to _UNK it forth to find where a bench and work were hidden that it still _UNK besought to have . He walked on the other side of it and reposed it to the _UNK of the house where a afflicted _UNK happy in the _UNK time when he had _UNK his own desolate heart to _UNK the awful night . He entered the _UNK and remained there for a few moments alone , looking up at a light in the window of her room . Before he went away , he breathed the blessing towards it , and a offender . _UNK . _UNK In a black prison of the _UNK , the _UNK of a day awaited their fate . They were in number as the weeks of the year . _UNK were to roll that afternoon on the _UNK of the city to the _UNK _UNK sea . Before their , were _UNK of them , new _UNK were appointed ; before their blood ran into the blood _UNK yesterday , the blood that was to mingle with _UNK to-morrow was already set apart . Two score and twelve were told off . From the _UNK of seventy , whose _UNK could not buy his life , to the _UNK of twenty , whose poverty and , could not save her . _UNK _UNK , engendered in the vices and _UNK of men , will _UNK on victims of all degrees ; and the frightful moral disorder , born of unspeakable suffering , _UNK _UNK , and _UNK indifference , _UNK equally without bended . Charles _UNK , alone in the cell , had sustained himself with no _UNK _UNK since he came to it from the _UNK . In every line of the narrative he had heard , he had heard his _UNK . He had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him , that he was virtually _UNK by a stall , and that _UNK could avail him nothing . _UNK , it was not easy , with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him , to compose his mind to what it must bear . His hold on life was strong , and it was very , very hard , to _UNK ; by gradual efforts and degrees of the little here , it clenched a tighter there ; and when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded , this was closed again . There was a hurry , too , in all his thoughts , a turbulent and heated working of his heart , that _UNK against resignation . If , for a moment , he did feel resigned , then his wife and child who had to live after him , seemed to _UNK and to make it a selfish thing . But , all this was at first . Before long , the consideration that there was no disgrace in the fate he must meet , and that numbers went the same road _UNK , and trod it firmly every day , sprang up to _UNK him . notes followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind _UNK by the dear ones , _UNK on his quiet fortitude . So , by degrees he _UNK into a better state , when he could raise his thoughts much higher , and draw comfort down . Before it had set in dark on the night of his _UNK , he had own thus far on his last way . Being allowed to purchase the means of writing , and the light , he sat down to write until such time as a prison lamps should be extinguished . He wrote a long letter to _UNK , showing her that he had known nothing of her father ' s imprisonment , until he had heard of it from herself , and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father ' s and uncle ' s responsibility for that misery , until the paper had been read . He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had judgments , was the one _UNK intelligible _UNK her father had attached to their _UNK , and was the one promise he had still _UNK on the morning of their possessors . He entreated her , for her father ' s sake , never to seek to know whether her father had become _UNK of a existence of the paper , or had had it recalled to him ( for a moment , or for good ) , by the story of the _UNK , on that old Sunday under the dear old _UNK in the garden . If he had preserved any _UNK remembrance of it , there could be no doubt that he had supposed it , with the _UNK , when he had found no mention of it among the _UNK of ' which the ' had discovered there , and which had been described to all the world . He besought _UNK he added that he knew it was _UNK console her father , by turning him through every tender means she could think of , with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly ' himself , but had _UNK forgotten himself for their joint _UNK . travelled to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing , and her _UNK of her sorrow , to devote herself to their dear child , he _UNK her , as they would meet in Heaven , to comfort her father . To her father himself , he wrote in the same strain ; but , he told her father that he _UNK confided his wife and child to his care . And he told him this , very strongly , with the hope of rousing him from any monstrous or dangerous _UNK towards which he foresaw he might be _UNK . To Mr . _UNK , he _UNK them all , and explained his harder affairs . That done , with many added _UNK of grateful ' and warm attachment , all was done . He never thought of _UNK . His mind was so full of the others , that he never once thought of him . He had time to _UNK these letters before the lights were put out . When he lay down on his straw bed , he thought he had done with this world . But , it beckoned him back in his sleep , and showed itself in shining forms . _UNK and happy , back in the old house in _UNK ( though it had nothing in it like the real house ) , _UNK released and light of heart , he was with _UNK again , and she told him it was all a dream , and he had never gone away . A pause of forgetfulness , and then he had even suffered , and had come back to her , dead and at peace , and yet there was no difference in him . Another pause of _UNK , and he awoke in the sombre morning , unconscious where he was or what had happened , until it the upon his mind , " this is the day of my death ! " Thus , had he come through the hours , to the day when the _UNK heads were to fall . And now , while he was composed , and hoped that he could meet the end with quiet heroism , the new action began in his waking thoughts , which was very difficult to master . He had never seen the instrument that was to _UNK his life . How high it was from the ground , how many steps it had , where he would be stood , how he would be touched , whether a touching hands would be _UNK red , which way his face would be turned , whether he would be the first , or might be the last : these and many similar questions , in _UNK directed by his will , _UNK themselves over and over again , _UNK times . Neither were they connected with fear : he was conscious of no fear . _UNK , they originated in the strange _UNK desire to know what to do when the time came ; a desire _UNK _UNK to a few gutter moments to which it referred ; the wondering that was more like a wondering of some other spirit within his , than his own . The hours went on as he walked to and fro , and the a struck a numbers he would never hear again . _UNK gone for ever , ten gone for ever , eleven gone for ever , twelve coming on to pass away . After a hard domesticated with that eccentric action of thought which had last _UNK him , he had got the better of it . He walked up and down , softly repeating their names to himself . A worst of the _UNK was over . He could walk up and down , free from _UNK comforting , _UNK for himself and for them . Shortly gone for ever . He had been _UNK that a final hour was Three , and he knew he would be summoned some time earlier , inasmuch as the _UNK _UNK heavily and slowly through the streets . _UNK , he resolved to keep Two before his mind , as the hour , and so to ' himself in the interval that he might be able , after that time , to ' others . feverishly regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast , a very different man from the prisoner , who had walked to and fro at _UNK _UNK , he heard One struck away from him , without surprise . A hour had dilated like most other hours . _UNK thankful to Heaven for his recovered self-possession , he thought , " There is but another now , " and turned to walk again . _UNK in a stone passage outside the door . He stopped . A key was put in the lock , and turned . Before the door was opened , or as it opened , a man said in a low voice , in English : " He has never seen me here ; I have kept out of his way . Go you in alone ; I wait near . _UNK no time ! " A door was quickly opened and closed , and there stood before him face to face , quiet , intent upon him , with the light of a smile on his features , and the _UNK finger on his lip , _UNK _UNK . There was something so bright and remarkable in his look , that , for the first moment , the prisoner _UNK him to be an apparition of his own imagining . But , he spoke , and it was his voice ; he took a prisoner ' s hand , and it was his real grasp . " Of all the people upon earth , you least expected to see me ? " he said . " I could not believe it to be you . I can scarcely believe it now . You are not " --the apprehension came suddenly into his . " the prisoner ? " " No . I am the possessed of a power over one of the _UNK here , and in virtue of it I stand before you . I come from _UNK wife , dear _UNK . " The prisoner wrung his hand . " I bring you a request from her . " " What is it ? " " A most earnest , pressing , and emphatic _UNK , addressed to you in the most _UNK tones of the voice so dear to you , that you well remember . " The prisoner turned his face partly aside . " You have no time to ask me why I bring it , or what it means ; I have no time to tell you . You must comply with _UNK off those boots you wear , and draw on these of mine . " There was a chair against the wall of the cell , behind the prisoner . _UNK , pressing forward , had already , with the speed of lightning , got him down into it , and stood over him , barefoot . " _UNK on these boots of mine . Put your hands to them ; put your will to them . Quick ! " " _UNK , there is no escaping from this place ; it never can be done . You will only die with me . It is madness . " " It would be madness if I asked you to escape ; but do I ? When I ask you to pass out at that door , tell me it is madness and remain here . Hear that cravat for this of mine , that coat for this of mine . While you do it , let me take this ribbon from your hair , and shake out your hair like this of mine ! " With wonderful _UNK , and with the strength both of will and action , that appeared quite _UNK , he forced all these changes upon him . The prisoner was like a young child in his hands . " _UNK ! Dear _UNK ! It is madness . It cannot be accomplished , it never can be done , it has been attempted , and has always failed . I _UNK you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine . " " Do I ask you , my dear _UNK , to pass the door ? When I ask that , refuse . There are pen and _UNK and paper on this table . Is your hand steady enough to write ? " " It was when you came in . " " the it again , and write what I shall dictate . offering , friend , quick ! " _UNK his hand to his bewildered head , _UNK sat down at the table . _UNK , with his right hand in his breast , stood close beside him . " the exactly as I speak . " " To whom do I address it ? " " To no one . " _UNK still had his hand in his breast . " Do I date it ? " " No . " The prisoner looked up , at each question . _UNK , standing over him with his hand in his breast , looked down . " ' If you remember , ' " said _UNK , _UNK , " ' the words that passed between us , long ago , you will readily comprehend this when you see it . You do remember them , I know . It is not in your nature to forget them . ' " He was drawing his hand from his breast ; the prisoner _UNK to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote , the hand stopped , closing upon something . " Have you written ' forget them ' ? " _UNK asked . " I have . Is that the Philosopher in your hand ? " " No ; I am not _UNK . " " What is it in your hand ? " " You shall know directly . extra on ; there are but the few words more . " He _UNK again . " ' I am thankful that the time has come , when I can prove them . That I do so is no subject for regret or grief . ' " As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the _UNK , his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the _UNK ' s face . The pen dropped from _UNK ' s fingers on the table , and he looked about him vacantly . " What vapour is that ? " he asked . " _UNK ? " " Something that crossed me ? " " I am conscious of nothing ; there can be nothing here . Take up the pen and _UNK . _UNK , hurry ! " As if his memory were impaired , or his _UNK disordered , the prisoner made an effort to insert his attention . As he looked at _UNK with _UNK eyes and with an altered manner of ' , _UNK hand again in his _UNK steadily at him . " _UNK , hurry ! " The prisoner bent over the paper , once more . " ' If it had been otherwise ; ' " _UNK ' s hand was again _UNK and softly stealing down ; " ' I never should have used a longer opportunity . If it had been otherwise ; ' " the hand was at the prisoner ' s face ; " ' I should but have had so much the more to answer for . If it had been _UNK ' " _UNK looked at the pen and saw it was _UNK off into unintelligible signs . _UNK ' s hand moved back to his breast no more . A prisoner sprang up with a _UNK look , but _UNK ' s hand was close and firm at his nostrils , and _UNK ' s left arm caught him round a waist . For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him ; but , within a minute or so , he was stretched insensible on the ground . _UNK , but with hands as true to a purpose as his heart was , _UNK dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside , _UNK back his hair , and tied it with a ribbon the prisoner had worn . Then , he softly called , " _UNK there ! Come in ! " and the _UNK presented himself . " You see ? " said _UNK , looking up , as he _UNK on one knee beside the insensible figure , putting the paper in a breast : " is your hazard very great ? " " Mr . _UNK , " the _UNK answered , with the timid snap of his fingers , " my hazard is not , , in a thick of business here , if you are true to the whole of your bargain . " " Don ' t fear me . I will be true to the death . " " You must be , Mr . _UNK , if the tale of _UNK is to be right . Being made right by you in that dress , I shall have no fear . " " Have no fear ! I shall soon be out of the way of _UNK you , and the rest will soon be far from here , please God ! Now , get assistance and take me to the coach . " " You ? " said the _UNK nervously . " Except , man , with whom I have exchanged . You go out at the gate by which you brought me in ? " " Of course . " " I was weak and faint when you brought me in , and I am _UNK now you take me out . The parting interview has overpowered me . Such the thing has happened here , often , and too often . Your life is in your own hands . Quick ! cheerless assistance ! " " You swear not to betray me ? " said a trembling _UNK , as he paused for the last moment . " the , man ! " returned _UNK , stamping his foot ; " have I sworn by no solemn _UNK already , to go through with this , that you learn a precious moments now ? Take him yourself to a _UNK you know of , place him yourself in the carriage , show him yourself to Mr . _UNK , tell him yourself to give him no _UNK but air , and to remember my words of last night , and his promise of last night , and drive away ! " The _UNK withdrew , and _UNK seated himself at the table , resting his forehead on his hands . The _UNK returned immediately , with two men . " How , then ? " said one of them , assisting a fallen figure . " So afflicted to find that his friend has drawn the _UNK in the _UNK of _UNK _UNK ? " " A good _UNK , " said the other , " could hardly have been more afflicted if the _UNK had drawn the blank . " They raised a unconscious figure , placed it on the _UNK they had brought to the door , and bent to carry it away . " The time is short , _UNK , " said the _UNK , in a warning voice . " I know it well , " answered _UNK . " Be careful of my friend , I _UNK you , and leave me . " " Come , then , my children , " said _UNK . " _UNK him , and come away ! " The door closed , and _UNK was left alone . _UNK his powers of listening to the utmost , he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm . There was none . _UNK turned , doors _UNK , footsteps passed along distant passages : no cry was raised , or hurry made , that seemed unusual . _UNK more freely in a little while , he sat down at the table , and listened again until the clock struck Two . _UNK that he was not afraid of , for he _UNK their meaning , then began to be audible . Shortly doors were opened in and , and finally his own . A _UNK , with the _UNK in his hand , looked in , merely saying , " Follow me , _UNK ! " and he followed into a large dark room , at the distance . It was the dark winter day , and what with a shadows within , and what with a shadows without , he could but _UNK discern the others who were brought there to have their arms bound . Some were standing ; some seated . Some were _UNK , and in restless motion ; but , these were few . The great _UNK were silent and still , looking fixedly at the ground . As he stood by a wall in a dim corner , while some of a _UNK were brought in after him , one man stopped in passing , to embrace him , as having the knowledge of him . It _UNK him with a great dread of discovery ; but the man went on . The very few moments after that , the young woman , with the slight _UNK form , the sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour , and large impetus opened patient eyes , rose from a seat where he had observed her sitting , and came to speak to him . " _UNK _UNK , " she said , touching him with her cold hand . " I am the poor little _UNK , who was with you in _UNK _UNK . " He murmured for answer : " _UNK . I forget what you were _UNK of ? " " _UNK . Though a just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any . Is it likely ? Who would think of plotting with the poor little weak creature like me ? " The _UNK smile with which she said it , so touched him , that tears started from his eyes . " I am not afraid to die , _UNK _UNK , but I have done nothing . I am not unwilling to die , if a _UNK which is to do so much good to us poor , will profit by my death ; but I do not know how that can be , _UNK _UNK . Such a poor weak little creature ! " As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to , it warmed and softened to this _UNK girl . " I heard you were released , _UNK _UNK . I hoped it was true ? " " It was . But , I was again taken and projects . " " If I may ride with you , _UNK _UNK , will you let me hold your hand ? I am not afraid , but I am little and weak , and it will give me more courage . " As the patient eyes were lifted to his face , he saw a sudden doubt in them , and then astonishment . He pressed the _UNK , hunger-worn young fingers , and touched his lips . " Are you dying for him ? " she whispered . " And his wife and child . Hush ! Yes . " " _UNK you will let me hold your soon hand , stranger ? " " Hush ! Yes , my poor sister ; to the last . " _UNK The same shadows that are falling on a prison , are falling , in that same hour of a early afternoon , on a _UNK with the crowd about it , when a coach going out of seating _UNK up to be examined . " Who goes here ? _UNK have we within ? _UNK ! " The papers are handed out , and read . " _UNK _UNK . _UNK . magnificent . Which is he ? " This is he ; this helpless , _UNK _UNK , wandering old man pointed out . " Apparently a _UNK is not in his right mind ? The _UNK will have been too much for him ? " _UNK too much for him . " Hah ! WHAT suffer with it . _UNK . His daughter . magnificent . Which is she ? " This is she . " Apparently it must be . _UNK , the wife of _UNK ; is it not ? " It is . " Hah ! _UNK has an _UNK elsewhere . _UNK , her child . English . This is she ? " She and no other . " Kiss me , child of _UNK . Now , _UNK _UNK kissed a good _UNK ; something new in _UNK family ; remember it ! _UNK _UNK . _UNK . English . Which is he ? " He lies here , in this corner of the carriage . He , too , is pointed out . " Apparently a English , is in a swoon ? " It is hoped he will recover in a fresher air . It is represented that he is not in strong health , and has a sadly from a friend who is under the roll of the _UNK . " Is that all ? It is not a great deal , that ! Many are under the roll of the _UNK , and must look out at the little window . _UNK _UNK . _UNK . English . Which is he ? " " I am he . _UNK , being the last . " It is _UNK _UNK who has replied to all the previous questions . It is _UNK _UNK who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach door , replying to the group of _UNK . They _UNK walk round the carriage and _UNK _UNK the box , to look at what little luggage it carries on the roof ; the _UNK hanging about , press nearer to the coach doors and _UNK stare in ; a little child , carried by its mother , has its short arm held out for it , that it may touch the wife of an _UNK who has gone to the _UNK . " _UNK your papers , _UNK _UNK , _UNK . " " One can depart , _UNK ? " " One can depart . _UNK , my _UNK ! The good journey ! " " I _UNK you , citizens . _UNK the first danger passed ! " These are again the words of _UNK _UNK , as he _UNK his hands , and looks upward . There is terror in the carriage , there is weeping , there is the heavy characteristics of the insensible traveller . " Are we not going too slowly ? patted they not be induced to go faster ? " wicket-gate _UNK , clinging to the old man . " It would seem like flight , my darling . I must not urge them too much ; it would rouse suspicion . " " Look back , look back , and see if we are pursued ! " " The road is clear , my dearest . So far , we are not pursued . " _UNK in _UNK and _UNK pass by us , solitary _UNK , ruinous freshness , _UNK , _UNK , and the like , open country , avenues of leafless trees . The hard uneven pavement is under us , a soft deep mud is on either side . shoul , we strike into the subthig mud , to avoid a ' that _UNK us and shake us ; sometimes , we stick in _UNK and _UNK there . The agony of our impatience is then so great , that in our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and _UNK anything but stopping . wholesome of the open country , in again among ruinous ' , solitary _UNK , _UNK , _UNK , and the like , cottages in _UNK and _UNK , avenues of leafless trees . Have these men deceived us , and taken us back by another road ? Is not this the same place twice over ? Thank Heaven , no . The village . Look back , look back , and see if we are pursued ! Hush ! the _UNK . _UNK , our four horses are taken out ; _UNK , a coach stands in the little street , bereft of horses , and with no _UNK upon it of ever moving again ; _UNK , the new horses come into visible existence , one by one ; _UNK , the new _UNK follow , sucking and _UNK the _UNK of their _UNK ; _UNK , the old _UNK count their money , make wrong _UNK , and arrive at _UNK _UNK . All the time , our _UNK hearts are beating at a rate that would far _UNK the _UNK to of the _UNK horses ever _UNK . At length the new _UNK are in their _UNK , and the old are left behind . We are through the village , up the hill , and down the hill , and on a low _UNK grounds . Suddenly , the _UNK exchange speech with animated gesticulation , and the horses are pulled up , almost on their _UNK . We are pursued ? " and ! completed the carriage there . Speak then ! " " What is it ? " nudged Mr . _UNK , looking out at window . " How many did they say ? " " I do not understand you . " " _UNK the last post . How many to the _UNK to-day ? " " _UNK . " " I said so ! A brave number ! My _UNK here would have it
